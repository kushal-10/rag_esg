Siemens Healthineers 
Notes to the Combined Financial Statements 
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
F | 8 
NOTE 1 Basis of preparation 
Purpose and content of the Combined Financial Statements  
On August 3, 2017, Siemens AG announced its plans to publicly list the Siemens Healthineers business in the form of an initial 
public offering (“IPO”). The parent company of Siemens Healthineers and thus the issuer of shares for the planned initial public 
offering will be Siemens Healthineers AG, located in Munich, Germany, a company which was established prior to the issuance of 
the Combined Financial Statements, but had not been established by September 30, 2017. 
Siemens Healthineers is to be separated from Siemens AG and its subsidiaries (“Siemens Group”) in two steps. In an initial 
preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separate companies have been transferred to separate legal entities. In a 
second step, all companies comprising the Siemens Healthineers business have been or will be bundled under Siemens Healthineers 
AG, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
According to the European Prospectus Regulation No. 809/2004, as amended (“EPV”), an issuer must present historical financial 
information covering the latest three fiscal years in its securities prospectus. Therefore, Siemens Healthineers presents historical 
financial information for the fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), from October 1, 2015 to 
September 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”) and from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015 (“fiscal 2015”). According to the European 
Prospectus Regulation No. 211/2007 Siemens Healthineers AG, as the issuer, has a “Complex Financial History” as of the share 
issuance date. The historical financial information represents the Siemens Healthineers business (hereafter referred to as “Siemens 
Healthineers”) under the control of Siemens AG and managed centrally by the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers. 
The Combined Financial Statements consist of Combined Statements of Income, Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income, 
Combined Statements of Financial Position, Combined Statements of Cash Flows, Combined Statements of Changes in Equity and 
Notes to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (collectively referred to 
hereafter as “Combined Financial Statements”). 
The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared and published in millions of euro (€ million). Rounding differences may 
occur in respect of individual amounts or percentages. 
The Combined Financial Statements were prepared on January 8, 2018 by the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers.  
Definition of Siemens Healthineers  
Siemens Healthineers is one of the world´s largest suppliers of technology to the healthcare industry and a leader in diagnostic 
imaging and laboratory diagnostics. It provides medical technology and software solutions as well as clinical consulting services, 
supported by a complete set of training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the continuum 
of care – from prevention and early detection to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care.  
Siemens Healthineers’ operations include: 
 Imaging, which offers diagnostic imaging products and a broad portfolio of advanced imaging and ultrasound systems and solutions; 
 Diagnostics offers products, services and solutions, including a broad array of  testing applications, in the areas of laboratory, point of 
care and molecular diagnostics; 
 Advanced Therapies is a supplier of advanced therapy products, services and solutions to the therapy departments of healthcare 
providers. 
 
Combined Financial Statements 
Siemens Healthineers has prepared these Combined Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). 
Since IFRS provides no guidelines for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, rules given in IAS 8.12 have been used. 
IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements 
and recognized industry practices.  
Following IAS 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach has been applied in the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens 
Healthineers. The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers reflect the Siemens Healthineers entities and the 
operations assigned to Siemens Healthineers as historically included in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statement of Siemens AG. 
Siemens Healthineers applies the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Combined Financial 
Statements as used by the Siemens Healthineers entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusion in the 
IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG.  

Siemens Healthineers 
Notes to the Combined Financial Statements 
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
F | 9 
The Combined Financial Statements for Siemens Healthineers are derived from the segment reporting for Healthineers as presented 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG. This segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrally 
managed functions prior to the legal separation which afterwards are regulated by service level agreements. In addition, in order to 
reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the scope of Siemens Healthineers, the following combination rules 
have been applied. The Management of Siemens Healthineers (as defined in Note 25 – Related party transactions) uses significant 
judgment in determining these combination rules. Thus, the Combined Financial Statements presented here do not necessarily reflect 
the financial position and results of operations that would have occurred if Siemens Healthineers had existed as a separate group in 
the periods presented. 
Scope of combination 
The scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers for the fiscal years ended September 30, 
2017, September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was determined on economic principles using the common management 
approach, i.e. the assets and liabilities which have been managed by the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers throughout the 
periods presented were included in the scope of combination. Accordingly, the approach is not based on the legal structure of 
Siemens Healthineers in the periods presented. However, it is reflective of the target legal structure which will be in place prior to the 
IPO. Consequently, business operations classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens 
AG during the periods presented and related to the Siemens Healthineers business have been excluded from the scope of combination 
for all periods presented. This refers to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the proceeds from the sale of the 
customer health service business unit to the US-based company Cerner Corp in 2014 and from the sale of the hearing aids business to 
the investment company EQT in 2015.  
For a list of legal entities fully included in the Combined Financial Statements as well as legal entities from which assets and 
liabilities already under the responsibility of the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers have been included in the Combined 
Financial Statements prior to their actual legal transfer, please refer to Note 27 – Scope of combination. 
During the period presented in the Combined Financial Statements, the following acquisitions and disposals occurred: 
Acquisitions  
Siemens Healthineers acquired the following businesses which were not material, either individually or in aggregate, and included 
them in the Combined Financial Statements: 
 
In March 2016, all shares of Neo New Oncology AG (“NEO”) were acquired. NEO provides a platform based on hybrid 
capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which facilitates analysis of tumor and therapy-relevant gene 
segments in an efficient and time-saving multiplex procedure. 
 
In October 2016, all shares of Conworx Technology GmbH (“Conworx”) were acquired. Conworx offers a complete point-
of-care device network along with all associated data management.  
 
In June 2017, Medicalis Corporation (“Medicalis”), a health care information technology company that provides clinical 
workflow and decision support solution, was acquired. 
Disposals  
In January 2015, Siemens Healthineers sold its microbiology business to Beckman Coulter Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Danaher Corporation. The activities of the microbiology business include systems for the identification and antibiotic susceptibility 
testing of microorganisms. The sale resulted in a gain of €64 million which was recognized in the line item Other operating income. 
The microbiology assets and liabilities were previously classified as held-for-sale.  
Pensions and similar obligations  
The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers present the pension obligations and corresponding plan assets allocated 
to Siemens Healthineers. The obligations were measured on the basis of expert actuarial valuations.  
The pension obligations for active employees as well as for retirees were legally transferred mainly in line with the individual carve-
outs from the Siemens Group to the newly founded Siemens Healthineers entities. Therefore, the majority of pension liabilities had 
legally been transferred either during fiscal 2015 or at the beginning of fiscal 2016. To ensure comparability throughout all periods 
presented in the Combined Financial Statements, pension obligations have retrospectively been allocated to Siemens Healthineers for 
the period prior to the legal carve-outs. This allocation has been performed based on an allocation key derived from the first actuarial 
reports after the carve-out. Pension obligations for retirees in Germany which were transferred to Siemens Healthineers in fiscal 2016 
are included in the Combined Financial Statements from the legal transfer date onwards.

Plan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal requirements for the major relevant countries. Where the 
respective employee has a right to claim a minimal funding or the plan assets were already allocated to individual employee 
accounts, plan assets have been retrospectively allocated to Siemens Healthineers for the period prior to the legal transfer of the 
assets. Due to the fact that the legal transfer of these plan assets has not yet been completed, the actual amounts of the plan assets to 
be transferred may differ from the plan assets presented in the Combined Financial Statements. 
For further details please also refer to Note 15 – Provisions for pensions and similar obligations.  
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes  
In accordance with IAS 12, “Income Taxes”, current and deferred income taxes are recognized for the purposes of the Combined 
Financial Statements taking into consideration local tax requirements. Income taxes are determined using the separate tax return 
approach under the assumption that the entities and operations of Siemens Healthineers constitute separate taxable entities.  
This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies and operations and tax groups within Siemens Healthineers 
are calculated separately. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis. In the Combined Financial Statements 
deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards were recognized to extent it is probable that they can be offset with future taxable 
income from the respective Siemens Healthineers’ entities.  
Tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of Siemens Healthineers entities and operations 
that did not constitute a separate tax payer in previous years were treated as contributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders, 
and are not included in the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers.  
The Management of Siemens Healthineers deems the approach as appropriate though not necessarily indicative of the tax expenses or 
income that would result for Siemens Healthineers as a separate group.  
For further details please also refer to Note 3 – Income taxes.  
Real Estate Assets 
Assets that have been leased from Siemens Real Estate and transferred to Siemens Healthineers in line with the legal reorganization 
have been included in the Combined Financial Statement from the occurrence of their legal transfer. 
Capital Structure  
The equity of Siemens Healthineers consists of the net assets attributable to Siemens Healthineers. The Combined Financial 
Statements do not show any subscribed capital, because Siemens Healthineers does not constitute a legal group during the periods 
presented. 
The equity of Siemens Healthineers as presented in the Combined Financial Statements has been impacted mainly by the following 
combination rules: 
a) 
any allocation of assets and liabilities to Siemens Healthineers in addition to those already included in the segment 
reporting for Healthineers as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG and prior to their actual 
legal transfer, was directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or contribution at the time of the allocation;   
b) 
any consideration given or received in the course of the formation of a group of entities either directly or indirectly 
controlled by Siemens Healthineers AG, was directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or contribution at the time of the 
transfer;  
c) 
any taxes paid from Siemens Group and related to Siemens Healthineers operations prior to the carve-out, were directly 
recognized in equity; 
d) 
any changes in the conversion of receivables and payables to cash related to Siemens Healthineers operations prior to the 
carve-out, were directly recognized in equity;  
c) and d) are necessary because in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG cash balances are not allocated to the 
Siemens Group operating segments, but managed centrally. Additionally, in Siemens Group legal entities tax payments are not 
assigned to operating segments. Therefore, taxes paid from Siemens Group and related to Siemens Healthineers operations as well as 
conversions of receivables and payables to cash related to Siemens Healthineers operations prior to the carve-out of Siemens 
Healthineers operations are presented in equity as deemed contributions or withdrawals. 
As the formation of Siemens Healthineers Group has not been finalized as of September 30, 2017, further changes in the capital 
structure may occur.

Related Party Transactions 
Transactions between Siemens Healthineers and the remaining Siemens Group are recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified 
as related party transactions. 
For further details please also refer to Note 25 – Related party transactions.  
Combined Statements of Cash Flows  
According to IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements, the Combined Statements of Cash Flows of Siemens Healthineers contain operating, 
investing and financing activities. Cash transactions resulting from the central cash management operated by the Siemens Group 
throughout the period presented as well as cash transactions with other Siemens Group entities in conjunction with the formation of 
the group of entities either directly or indirectly controlled by Siemens Healthineers AG, have been included in the line item Other 
transactions/ financing with Siemens Group in the Cash Flows from Financing Activities of the Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

NOTE 2 Significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
The accounting principles set out below have, unless stated otherwise, been applied consistently for all periods presented in these 
Combined Financial Statements.  
Key accounting estimates and judgments – Certain of these accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve 
complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and 
susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the 
results of operations, financial positions and cash flows of Siemens Healthineers. Critical accounting estimates could also involve 
estimates where Siemens Healthineers reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens 
Healthineers cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment. Estimates and 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis, and changes in estimates and assumptions are recognized in the period in which the 
changes occur and in future periods impacted by the changes. 
The estimates in accordance with the basis of preparation made in these Combined Financial Statements are consistent with estimates 
made for the same date in accordance with the reporting requirements under IFRS as part of the consolidation group of Siemens AG, 
unless there is objective evidence that those estimates are not in accordance with IFRS on a stand-alone basis. The areas involving a 
high degree of judgment and where estimates and assumptions are significant to the Combined Financial Statements are disclosed. 
Business combinations – Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent 
liabilities) are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.  
Foreign currency translation – Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, 
are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Combined Statements of Income are 
translated using average exchange rates of the respective periods. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within 
equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign operation is recognized. The Combined 
Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates of the respective periods, whereas cash and cash equivalents are 
translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.  
Foreign currency transaction – Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are 
recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially 
recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to 
functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency 
revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary 
are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate. 
Revenue recognition – Under the condition that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, revenue is recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Siemens Healthineers and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless 
of when the payment is being made. In cases where the inflow of economic benefits is not probable due to customer related credit 
risks, the revenue recognized is subject to the amount of payments irrevocably received. 
Sale of goods: Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, 
usually on delivery of the goods.  
Rendering of services: Revenue from services arises mainly from long-term service contracts recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the contract. 
Sales from multiple element arrangements: Sales of goods and services as well as software arrangements often involve the provision 
of multiple elements. In these cases Siemens Healthineers determines whether the contract or arrangement contains more than one 
unit of accounting. If certain criteria are met, foremost if the delivered element(s) has (have) value to the customer on a stand-alone 
basis, the arrangement is separated and the appropriate revenue recognition convention is then applied to each separate unit of 
accounting. Generally, the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair 
values. If the criteria for the separation of units of accounting are not met, revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the 
period in which the last undelivered element is delivered.  
Income from interest: Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.  
Income from leases: Operating lease income for equipment rentals is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Receivables from finance leases, in which Siemens Healthineers as lessor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership to the customer are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Finance income is subsequently 
recognized based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment using the effective interest method.

Functional costs – In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the 
corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets. 
Product-related expenses – Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the 
time the related sale is recognized. 
Research and development costs – Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are 
capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 13 years.  
Goodwill – Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or 
changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group 
of cash-generating units, represented by a segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes. During the periods presented, goodwill was tested for impairment based on the cash-generating unit structure used at that 
time by Siemens Group to monitor goodwill as Siemens Healthineers and the new reporting structure did not exist in the past. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit or the 
group of cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of 
the cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit or this group of cash-generating units is recognized. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s or the group of cash-generating units’ fair value less costs to sell and 
its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These 
values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future 
periods. 
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is 
allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful 
integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the 
outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are 
based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s best estimate about 
future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which 
management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted 
average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and 
ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.  
Other intangible assets – Siemens Healthineers amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their 
respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to 
five years, except for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets acquired in 
business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific 
acquisitions range from four to 15 years for customer relationships and trademarks and from five to 16 years for technology.  
Property, plant and equipment –is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is 
recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Factory and office buildings 
20 to 50 years 
Other buildings 
 
5 to 10 years 
Technical machinery & equipment  
5 to 10 years 
Furniture & office equipment 
 
generally 5 years 
Equipment leased to others 
 
generally 5 to 8 years 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets – Siemens Healthineers reviews property, plant and 
equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. 
Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the 
assets’ recoverable amount which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.

Income taxes – Tax positions under respective local tax laws and tax authorities’ views can be complex and subject to different 
interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for 
prior years and are taken into account based on management’s considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of 
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date in the respective jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of 
existing taxable temporary differences and established tax planning opportunities. As of each period-end, Siemens Healthineers 
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on projected future taxable profits. Based upon the level of historical taxable 
income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, Siemens 
Healthineers believes it is probable to realize the benefits of these deductible differences. As future developments are uncertain and 
partly beyond Siemens Healthineers’ control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in 
which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the 
assumption. 
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally 
determined on the basis of an average or first-in, first-out method. 
Defined benefit plans – Siemens Healthineers measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach 
reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the 
net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected 
rates of future salary increase and expected rates of future pension progression are considered. The assumptions used for the 
calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and 
interest income and expense of the following year. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the 
discount rates for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year’s period-end 
date.  
Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs 
unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are 
recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount of the line item Provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens Healthineers offsets the fair value of the plan assets with the DBO. Siemens 
Healthineers recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling. 
Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts 
included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in the line item Other comprehensive income, 
net of income taxes. 
Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression 
and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration 
and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bond 
yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual 
developments. 
Provisions – A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that Siemens Healthineers has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision. 
Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement 
obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens Healthineers 
records a provision for onerous sales contracts when current estimates of total contract costs exceed expected contract revenue.  
Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable 
judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the 
reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of 
the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new 
developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously 
recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens Healthineers may incur charges in excess of the recorded 
provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens Healthineers’ financial 
position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.

Termination benefits – Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity’s offer made in order to encourage voluntary 
redundancy before the normal retirement date or from an entity’s decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in 
accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the 
offer of those benefits. 
Financial instruments – A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Siemens Healthineers does not use the category held-to-maturity and does not use the 
option to designate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at inception (Fair Value Option). Based 
on their nature, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost and 
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value and as receivables from finance leases. Regular way sales of financial 
assets are accounted for at the trade date. Initially, financial instruments are recognized at their fair value. Transaction costs are only 
included in determining the carrying amount, if the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned - cash and cash 
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, loans and receivables, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost or financial 
assets and liabilities classified as held for trading.  
Cash and cash equivalents – Siemens Healthineers considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity 
from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost. 
Loans and receivables – Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method less any impairment losses. Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized using separate 
allowance accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts involves significant management judgment and review of individual 
receivables based on individual customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and analysis of historical bad debts on a 
portfolio basis. For the determination of the country-specific component of the individual allowance, Siemens Healthineers also 
considers country credit ratings, which are based on information from external rating agencies. Regarding the determination of the 
valuation allowance derived from a portfolio-based analysis of historical bad debts, a decline of receivables in volume results in a 
corresponding reduction of such provisions and vice versa. 
Financial liabilities – Siemens Healthineers measures financial liabilities, except for derivative financial instruments, at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method.  
Derivative financial instruments – Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts are measured at 
fair value and classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, 
in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax).  
Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are 
recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax), and any ineffective 
portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods 
in which the hedged item affects net income.  
Share-based payment – Share-based payment awards at Siemens Healthineers are predominately classified as cash-settled to fulfill 
the specific requirements for share-based payment transactions among group entities. Fair value is measured at grant date, updated each 
quarter and expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of Siemens AG shares, considering 
dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to and market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable.  
Expenses related to share-based payment awards for Siemens Healthineers employees, which were granted by a Siemens Group 
entity and for which the contractual obligation to settle the shared-based payment liability has not been transferred to Siemens 
Healthineers, are included in the Combined Financial Statements as equity-settled awards.

Recent accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted 
The following pronouncements, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”),  are not yet effective and have not 
yet been adopted by Siemens Healthineers:  
In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 introduces a single approach for the classification and 
measurement of financial assets according to their cash flow characteristics and the business model they are managed in, and 
provides a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. IFRS 9 also includes new regulations regarding the application of 
hedge accounting to better reflect an entity’s risk management activities especially with regard to managing non-financial risks. The 
new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Siemens Healthineers will adopt IFRS 9 
for the fiscal year beginning as of October 1, 2018 and will not adjust comparative figures for the preceding fiscal year, in 
accordance with IFRS 9 transitional provisions. Siemens Healthineers is currently assessing the effects of the adoption of IFRS 9 and 
expects only limited impact on the financial statements. Siemens Healthineers will adopt the IFRS 9 hedge accounting rules 
prospectively from October 1, 2018. It is expected that all existing hedge accounting relationships will also meet the hedge 
accounting requirements under IFRS 9. 
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For further details please refer to Note 26 – Effects 
from the adoption of IFRS 15. 
 
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases. IFRS 16 eliminates the current classification model for lessee’s lease contracts as 
either operating or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months. This brings the previous off-balance leases on the 
balance sheet in a manner largely comparable to current finance lease accounting. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2019. Siemens Healthineers will adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning as of October 1, 2019, 
presumably by applying the modified retrospective approach, i.e. comparative figures for the preceding year would not be adjusted. 
Currently, it is expected that the majority of the transition effect relates to real estate leased by Siemens Healthineers. Siemens 
Healthineers is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 16 on the financial statements. 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The interpretation clarifies the recognition and 
measurement requirements when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, an entity shall 
consider whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept the uncertain tax treatment. IFRIC 23 is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while earlier application is permitted. Siemens Healthineers is currently 
assessing the impacts of adopting the interpretation on the financial statements. 
 
In addition to the standards presented above in detail, the IASB has issued further standards, interpretations and amendments to 
standards and interpretations whose application is also not yet mandatory and which in part require EU endorsement before they can 
be applied. Siemens Healthineers currently assumes that the application of these standards, interpretations and amendments will not 
have a material impact on the presentation of the financial statements.

The current income tax expenses in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 include adjustments recognized for current tax of prior years in the 
amount of €62 million, €38 million and €(18) million, respectively. The deferred tax expense (benefit) in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 
includes tax effects of the origination and reversal of temporary differences of €49 million, €6 million and €(7) million, respectively.  
In Germany, the calculation of current tax is based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, a 
solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%. For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based 
on the local tax laws and applicable tax rates in the individual foreign countries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in Germany and 
abroad are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. 
Income tax expense (current and deferred) differs from the amounts computed by applying a combined statutory German income tax 
rate of 31% as follows:

The goodwill included in the Combined Financial Statements is based on the goodwill attributable to the companies or businesses 
that were transferred to Siemens Healthineers during the legal reorganization. Total amounts correspond to the historically reported 
amounts in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens (predecessor values). During the periods presented, goodwill was 
tested for impairment based on the cash-generating unit structure used at that time by Siemens to monitor goodwill as the new 
reporting structure did not exist in the past. No goodwill impairment was recognized. 
Siemens Healthineers defined operating segments based on the announced new reporting structure. As a cash-generating unit or a 
group of cash-generating units cannot be larger than an operating segment goodwill has been reallocated to the reorganized reporting 
structure based on relative values. Accordingly, the reallocation did not result in any goodwill impairments. Siemens Healthineers’ 
groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are represented by a segment – see Note 23 – Segment information.

NOTE 15 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
Siemens Healthineers provides post-employment plans, which are accounted for either as defined benefit plans or defined 
contribution plans, to almost all of the German employees and the majority of the foreign employees. 
Defined benefit plans 
The defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by Siemens Healthineers. Only to a 
certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take into account country specific 
differences. Siemens Healthineers’ major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws and 
bilateral agreements with benefit trusts (trust agreement) those plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries. The defined 
benefit plans cover 48,000 participants, including 25,000 active employees, 10,500 former employees with vested benefits and 
12,500 retirees and surviving dependents in 36 countries. 
Where Siemens Healthineers employees participate in Siemens Group’s pension plans and the respective pension trusts, Siemens 
Healthineers and Siemens Group bear the financial impact individually from pension obligations related to the respective employees. 
As the majority of the Siemens Healthineers’ pension liabilities derive from four countries (ca. 95% in fiscal 2017), the pension 
landscape in these countries are described detailed below. 
Germany: 
In Germany, Siemens Healthineers provides pension benefits through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens 
Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens Healthineers’ active employees 
participates in the BSAV. Those benefits are predominantly based on contributions made by Siemens Healthineers and returns earned 
on such contributions, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by Siemens Healthineers. In connection with the implementation of 
the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation 
increases. However, these frozen plans still expose Siemens Healthineers to investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. In 
general, no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply in Germany.  
The BSAV as well as most of the frozen legacy plans are currently funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA) whose sole 
trustor is Siemens AG. For parts of the frozen legacy plans (Siemens Pensionsfonds AG) and the deferred compensation plans, plan 
assets have been allocated to Siemens Healthineers and are therefore included in the numbers below. However, no plan assets have 
been allocated to Siemens Healthineers for the BSAV and the majority of the frozen legacy plans.   
U.S.: 
U.S. Siemens Healthineers currently participate in the defined benefit and defined contribution plans sponsored by Siemens 
Corporation.  The defined benefit plans sponsored by Siemens Corporation have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit 
accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. The pension plans are subject to the funding requirements under the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended, (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum 
funding level of 80% in defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, the sponsoring employers may 
contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries. For all funded U.S. 
pension plans, plan assets have been allocated to Siemens Healthineers.  
U.K.: 
Presently Siemens Healthineers offers defined benefit and defined contribution benefits through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for 
which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued (deferred and in payment) defined benefits is 
mandatory. Siemens Healthineers is currently a participating employer in this pension trust established by Siemens plc. The required 
annual funding of the defined benefit sections is determined by a funding valuation carried out at least every third year based on legal 
requirements. For the Siemens Benefit Scheme as well as the smaller pension plans in U.K., plan assets have been allocated to 
Siemens Healthineers. 
Switzerland: 
Following the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying 
employees. Accordingly Siemens Healthineers in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by 
external foundations. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and the asset management, as well as for any 
changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. Siemens Healthineers is required to make 
total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan 
the participating companies together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-
defined framework of recovery measures.

Basis for allocation of Siemens Healthineers’ pension plans administrated by Siemens Group  
During the periods presented, Siemens Healthineers employees in most countries participated in Siemens Group’s pension plans and 
the respective pension trusts. For these plans, pension benefits are administrated by Siemens Group, but separated for each legal 
entity. 
The determination of defined benefit obligation at fiscal year-end of the respective carve-outs is based on the service of the 
employees under the respective plan. This defined benefit obligation is also the basis for the proportional split of the defined benefit 
obligation between Siemens Group and Siemens Healthineers for fiscal years prior to the respective carve outs.  
Plan assets are not managed separately for each participating entities and are allocated to participating entities based on the allocated 
defined benefit obligation or the plan beneficiaries. 
The service costs are based on the service of the employees under the respective plans. The interest costs and interest income are 
based on the allocated DBO and plan assets respectively. 
The legal separation of the majority of the respective plan assets will take place during fiscal 2018 taking into account legal 
requirements and therefore, might be different to the allocation applied in the Combined Financial Statements.

Net interest expenses related to provisions for pensions and similar obligations amounted to €31 million, €50 million and €32 
million, respectively, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The DBO is attributable to active employees 40%, 42% and 50%, to former 
employees with vested rights 19%, 20% and 22%, to retirees and surviving dependents 41%, 38% and 28% respectively, in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015. 
The position “business combinations, disposals and other” include a transfer of deferred plan members and retirees in Germany in 
fiscal 2016 of DBO €704 million and plan assets of €281 million from Siemens AG to Siemens Healthcare GmbH decided on the 
Siemens annual shareholder meeting January 26, 2016, effective of October 1, 2015.

€65 million as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
During the periods presented, sensitivity determinations apply the same methodology as applied for the determination of the post-
employment benefit obligation. Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.

Asset Liability Matching Strategies 
A decline in the plans’ funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from 
changing parameters is considered as a significant risk. Accordingly, a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit 
obligations (Asset Liability Matching) has been implemented. Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold 
(Value-at-Risk). The concept, the Value-at-Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and 
adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of senior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on 
quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as 
part of risk management.

As plan assets are not separately managed for participating entities, for each plan the respective plan assets have been allocated to the 
different asset classes proportionally to the plan assts allocation of Siemens AG. 
Virtually all equity securities have quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of fixed income securities is based on prices 
provided by price service agencies. The fixed income securities are traded in highly liquid markets and almost all fixed income 
securities are investment grade. Alternative investments mostly include hedge funds; additionally, private equity and real estate 
investments are included. Multi strategy funds comprise absolute return funds and diversified growth funds that invest in various 
asset classes within a single fund and aim to stabilize return and reduce volatility. Derivatives predominantly consist of financial 
instruments for hedging interest rate risk. 
Future cash flows 
Employer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in fiscal 2018 are €92 million. Over the next ten fiscal years, 
average annual benefit payments of €190 million, €200 million and €146 million, respectively, are expected as of September 30, 
2017, 2016 and 2015. The weighted average duration of the DBO for Siemens Healthineers defined benefit plans was 14 years as of 
September 30, 2017, 15 years as of September 30, 2016 and 13 years as of September 30, 2015. 
Defined contribution plans and state plans 
The amount recognized as expense for defined contribution plans amounts to €150 million, €153 million and €141 million in fiscal 
2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. Contributions to state plans amount to €244 million, €241 million and €243 million in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

F | 36 
The majority of the Siemens Healthineers’ provisions are expected to result in cash outflows during the next one to 15 years. 
Warranties relate to products sold. Order related losses and risks are primarily provided for contracts in which the unavoidable costs 
of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Other provisions 
include various types of provisions, such as provisions for asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and 
equipment as well as provisions for legal proceedings. 
Siemens Healthineers is in the course of its normal business operations involved in Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. At 
present, Siemens Healthineers does not expect any matters to have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations 
and/or its cash flows.  
 
 
NOTE 17 Equity 
As stated in Note 1 - Basis of preparation, Siemens Healthineers was not a legal group for Consolidated Financial Statements reporting 
purposes in accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, in the periods presented. The equity was presented on the basis 
of the aggregation of the net assets of the Siemens Healthineers business under the control of Siemens AG and centrally managed by the 
Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers. 
Since the combined group does not show any subscribed capital, a presentation of earnings per share in accordance with IAS 33, 
Earnings per share, is not applicable.  
Capital Management  
Capital Management for Siemens Healthineers was performed by Siemens Group and includes the consideration of legal requirements 
relating to the equity and liquidity requirements of Siemens AG and Siemens Group during the periods presented.  
Other changes in equity 
During the periods presented in the Combined Financial Statements, the line item Other changes in equity as included in the Combined 
Statements of Changes in Equity mainly contains specifics in relation to the combination rules described in Note 1 - Basis of preparation.

€2,050 million and €1,845 million 
 
2) Thereof including equity instruments classified as available-for-sale, for which a fair value could not be reliably measured and which are recognized at cost (2017: €42 million, 2016: 
€44 million and 2015: €40 million). In addition, the fair value (Level 1) of available-for-sales financial assets as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounting to €8 million, €6 million and 
€6 million  
 
3) Reported in the following line items: Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, Trade payables, Other current financial liabilities, Long-term debt, Other financial liabilities - 
except for separately disclosed derivative financial instruments; including obligations under finance lease as of 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounting to €24 million, €22 million and €22 million 
 
The loans and receivables and the financial liabilities measured at amortized costs also include receivables and liabilities under finance 
leases in which Siemens Healthineers is the lessor or lessee and which therefore are accounted in accordance with IAS 17.  
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (all short-term), loans from banks, trade payables (all short-
term), short-term payables to Siemens Group as well as other current financial assets and other current financial liabilities approximate 
their carrying amount due to short-term maturities of these instruments.  
The carrying amount of the other liabilities to Siemens Group (residual term > 1year) which related to Siemens Healthineers’ business in 
the United States was €5,052 million and €5,343 million as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (see Note 14 – Debt) while the 
fair values amounted to €4,883 million and €5,327 million, respectively which are based on prices provided by price service agencies at 
the period-end date (Level 2). The fair value of the remaining long-term loans to Siemens Healthineers provided by Siemens Group 
approximate the carrying amount as the interest rates approximate market rates.  
The fair values of obligations under finance lease as well as other financial liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows 
using market rates. The fair values approximate the carrying amount because these obligations are mainly short-term.  
Long-term receivables are evaluated by Siemens Healthineers based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, 
and individual creditworthiness of the customer. Based on this evaluation, allowances for these receivables are taken into account. The 
carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, approximate the fair value.

Siemens Healthineers enters into derivative contracts with Siemens Corporate Treasury in accordance with Siemens Group policies. The 
fair values of derivative financial instruments depend on the specific type of instrument.  
The fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted 
market prices or based on option pricing models. In determining the fair values of the derivative financial instruments, no compensating 
effects from underlying transactions are taken into consideration. 
The levels of the fair value hierarchy and its application to the financial assets and financial liabilities are described below:  
Level 1:   
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2:   
 
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3:  
 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  
As part of Siemens Healthineers’ risk management approach, derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the risks resulting 
primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, Siemens Healthineers does not have any material derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate 
or commodity prices. Siemens Healthineers is mainly financed by Siemens Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG which is also actively 
managing the interest rate risks.  
For additional information regarding Siemens Healthineers’ risk management please refer to Note 20 – Financial Risk Management.  
Foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship 
Risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt, firm commitments and forecast 
transactions were centrally managed by Siemens Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG in favor of Siemens Healthineers.  
Under this approach the risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange 
contracts, foreign currency swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting 
treatment.  
Cash flow hedges 
Siemens Healthineers’ operating units apply hedge accounting for certain significant transactions and firm commitments denominated in 
foreign currencies. In particular, Siemens Healthineers has entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of 
variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. 
As of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the maximum maturity of the main portion of derivative financial instruments which are used 
to hedge future cash flows is 12 months.  
Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedging instruments in foreign-currency cash flow hedges 
are recorded in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.

NOTE 20 Financial risk management 
Siemens Healthineers is managed centrally by the Managing Board, which is responsible for the operating business of Siemens 
Healthineers. It manages and controls its financial risks in accordance with Siemens Group policies. During the periods presented, 
Siemens Healthineers delegated responsibilities to central functions of Siemens Group.  
Market risks  
Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for Siemens Healthineers. Its 
worldwide operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates.  
In order to optimize the allocation of the financial resources across its segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens 
Healthineers identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. Siemens Healthineers seeks to manage and control these 
risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities, and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed 
appropriate. Regarding financing activities monitoring and control was performed by Siemens AG in the reporting period.  
The management of financial market risk is a priority for Siemens Healthineers’ management. As a member of management, the 
Chief Financial Officer has specific responsibility for this part of the overall risk management system. For practical business 
purposes, management delegates responsibilities to central functions, like the Siemens Corporate Treasury department, and to 
individual Siemens Healthineers’ entities.  
In order to quantify market risks Siemens Healthineers has implemented a system based on parametric variance-covariance Value at 
Risk (VaR). The concept of VaR is also used for internal management of the treasury activities of Siemens Group. The VaR figures 
are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% 
confidence level.  
Actual results that are included in the Combined Statements of Income or Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income may 
differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. While the Combined Statements of Income and 
Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model 
with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss which will not be exceeded within ten days with a 
probability of 99.5%.  
Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some 
limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within 
this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means, that there is a 0.5% 
statistical probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic 
behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic 
behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.  
Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest bearing investments, that Siemens Healthineers’ pension plans hold 
are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  
 
Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
Transaction risk 
Each Siemens Healthineers entity conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a 
currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of 
business Siemens Healthineers’ entities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar 
and the euro.  
Siemens Healthineers defines foreign exchange rate exposure as the net amount of foreign currency denominated monetary items of the 
Combined Statements of Financial Position in addition to foreign currency denominated cash inflows and cash outflows from anticipated 
transactions at least for the following three months. This foreign currency exposure is determined based on the respective functional 
currencies of the exposed Siemens Healthineers entities. 
Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective 
currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.  

Siemens Healthineers 
Notes to the Combined Financial Statements 
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
F | 41 
Siemens Healthineers’ entities are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. Financing from 
Siemens Group or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency.  
Siemens Healthineers’ entities are bound by a foreign exchange risk management system established within the Siemens Group. Each 
Siemens Healthineers’ entity is responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure.  
The binding guideline provides the concept for the identification and determination of the single net currency position and commits the 
entities to hedge at least 75% but no more than 100% of their net foreign currency exposure. Hedging transactions are carried out 
primarily with the Siemens Corporate Treasury of Siemens Group as counterparty. 
As of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was €94 million, €64 million and 
€119 million.   
This VaR was calculated under consideration of items of the Combined Statements of Financial Position in addition to firm 
commitments which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency denominated cash flows from forecast 
transactions for the following twelve months.  
Translation risk 
Many Siemens Healthineers’ entities are located outside the euro zone. Since the financial reporting currency of Siemens Healthineers is 
the euro, the financial statements of these entities are translated into euro for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. To 
consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based 
operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation 
of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Siemens Healthineers’ combined equity position.  
 
 

Siemens Healthineers

for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
F | 42 
Interest rate risk  
Siemens Healthineers’ exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates to short-term bank loans and money market 
borrowings and investments at Siemens Financial Services (“SFS”), mainly with fixed rates of interest. Long-term liabilities mainly 
relate to loans with Siemens Group.   
Siemens Healthineers is mainly financed by Siemens Group through SFS and interest rate risk management is performed at the level of 
Siemens AG. Consequently, until the end of fiscal 2017, Siemens Healthineers did not actively manage its interest rate risk. As of 
September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the VaR relating to interest rates was €2 million, €1 million and €1 million.   
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk results from Siemens Healthineers’ inability to meet its financial liabilities. In the periods presented Siemens 
Healthineers was therefore largely financed by Siemens Group through SFS and invested excess liquidity using Siemens AG’s cash 
pooling and cash management systems.  
In addition, Siemens Healthineers has implemented an effective working capital and cash management. 
The Siemens Healthineers’ liquidity reserve as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of cash and cash equivalents amounts to 
€184 million, €206 million and €73 million, respectively.  
The following table reflects the contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected 
undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an 
instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens Healthineers could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial 
liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing as of September 30, 2017.

The risk implied from the values shown in the table above, reflects the one-sided scenario of cash outflows only. Obligations under 
trade payables and other financial liabilities including finance leases, mainly originate from the financing of assets used in Siemens 
Healthineers’ ongoing operations such as property, plant, equipment and investments in working capital – e.g. inventories and trade 
receivables.  
These assets are considered in Siemens Healthineers’ overall liquidity risk management. To monitor existing financial assets and 
liabilities as well as to enable an effective controlling of future risks, Siemens Healthineers participates in a comprehensive risk 
reporting established by Siemens Group, which covers its worldwide business.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in cash and earnings if the customer is unable to pay its obligations in due time or if the 
value of collateral declines.  
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of Siemens 
Healthineers’ risk management system. Siemens Healthineers is bound to the credit policy implemented by Siemens Group. In 
principle, each Siemens Healthineers’ entity is responsible for managing credit risk in its operating activities. Depending on the 
nature of the operating activities and the level of credit risk, additional credit risk monitoring and controls are performed both by 
each entity and by Siemens Group which can perform further credit evaluations and ratings, if applicable. Ratings and individually 
defined credit limits are mainly based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with the input consisting of information obtained 
from the customer, external rating agencies, data service providers and credit default experiences. Ratings and credit limits are 
carefully considered in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers by Siemens 
Healthineers.  
 
For analysis and monitoring of the credit risk Siemens Healthineers applies different systems and processes developed by Siemens 
Group. A central IT application is available that processes data from the operating units together with rating and default information 
and calculates an estimate which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. In addition to this automated process, 
qualitative information is considered in particular to incorporate the latest developments.  
Certain operating entities of Siemens Healthineers transferred their current trade receivables along with the inherent credit risk to the 
Siemens Credit Warehouse, but are still responsible for the administration of the trade receivables. The Siemens Credit Warehouse 
actively identifies, quantifies and manages the credit risk in its portfolio, such as by selling or hedging exposure to specific 
customers, countries and industries.  
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by their carrying 
amount.  
As of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the collateral held for financial instruments classified as financial assets measured at 
amortized costs amounted to €72 million, €51 million and €69 million, respectively.  
Concerning trade receivables and other receivables, as well as loans or receivables which are neither impaired nor past due, there 
were no indications that defaults in payment obligations will occur, lead to a decrease in the net assets. Overdue financial instruments 
are generally impaired on a portfolio basis in order to reflect losses incurred within the respective portfolios. When substantial 
expected payment delays become evident, overdue financial instruments are assessed individually for additional impairment and are 
further allowed for as appropriate.

Notes to the Combined Financial Statements 
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015

NOTE 21 Share-based payments 
Share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Share-
based payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. At 
Siemens Group level, these share-based payment plans are predominantly designed and accounted for as equity-settled plans and to a 
limited extent as cash-settled plans. 
In the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers the classification of share-based payment plans has been adjusted to 
fulfill the specific requirements for share-based payment transactions among group entities. In the majority of the cases, Siemens 
Healthineers carries the contractual obligation against its employees to settle the share-based payment transactions at the end of the 
vesting period. Consequently, Siemens Healthineers accounts for these share-based payment plans as cash-settled plans.  
The carrying amount of liabilities from share-based payment transactions, included in the line item Other liabilities and Other current 
liabilities in the Combined Financial Statements, is €143 million as of September 30, 2017 (€92 million and €50 million for the years 
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). Total pretax expense for share-based payment amounted to €81 million for the year 
ended September 30, 2017 (€67 million and €18 million for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). 
Stock Awards 
Siemens Healthineers grants stock awards to members of the senior management, and other eligible employees. Stock awards are subject 
to a restriction period of about four years and entitle the beneficiary to receive Siemens AG shares without payment of consideration 
following the restriction period. 
Stock awards are tied to performance criteria of Siemens AG. The annual target amount for stock awards can be bound to the average of 
earnings per share (EPS, basic) of the past three fiscal years and/or to the share price performance of Siemens AG relative to the share 
price performance of five important competitors (SPAC) during the four-year restriction period. The target attainment for the 
performance criteria SPAC ranges between 0% and 200%. If the target attainment of the prospective performance-based target of 
Siemens AG stock relative to five competitors exceeds 100%, an additional cash payment results corresponding to the outperformance. 
The vesting period is four years. 
In fiscal 2017, 289,246 stock awards were granted contingent upon attaining the prospective performance-based target of Siemens AG 
stock relative to five competitors (247,848 stock awards and 133,723 stock awards in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). The fair 
value of these stock awards amounting to €19 million in fiscal 2017 (€14 million and €7 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, 
respectively), was calculated by applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2017 inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility 
of Siemens AG shares of 22.79% (22% and 22% in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively) and a market price of €107.95 per Siemens 
AG share (€92.86 and €88.03 in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic 
volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to 0.03% in fiscal 2017 (up to 0.1% and up to 0.3% in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 
2015, respectively) and an expected dividend yield of 3.33% in fiscal 2017 (3.8% and 3.8% in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 
Assumptions concerning share price correlations were determined by reference to historic correlations. 
Furthermore during fiscal 2017, 47,090 stock awards were granted to members of the senior management, and other eligible employees 
for extraordinary achievements based on a special allocation from the CEO of the Siemens Group (58,470 stock awards and 35,638 stock 
awards in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). These stock awards are only subject to a restriction period of about four years. The 
fair value amounts to €5 million in fiscal 2017 (€4 million and €3 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 
Changes in the number of stock awards held by members of the senior management, and other eligible employees are:

Share Matching Program and its underlying plans 
In fiscal 2017, Siemens AG issued a new tranche under each of the plans of the Share Matching Program. 
Share Matching Plan 
Under the Share Matching Plan senior managers may invest a specified part of their variable compensation in Siemens AG shares 
(investment shares). The shares are purchased at the market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive 
the right to receive one Siemens AG share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares 
continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by 
Siemens Group including Siemens Healthineers until the end of the vesting period.  
Monthly Investment Plan 
Under the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens 
AG shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a 
month. If the Managing Board of Siemens AG decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the 
Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share 
Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years since fiscal 2016 (in fiscal 2015 about three years). The 
Managing Board of Siemens AG decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are transferred to 
the Share Matching Plan as of February 2017, February 2016 and February 2015, respectively. 
Base Share Program 
Under the Base Share Program employees of participating Siemens Healthineers companies may invest a fixed amount of their 
compensation in Siemens AG shares. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the 
right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. The fair value of the 
Base Share Program amounted to €4 million in fiscal 2017 (€4 million and €4 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively).

The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted in fiscal 2017 amounting to €92.60 per share (€65.78 and €69.43 per share in 
fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively) was determined as the market price of Siemens AG shares less the present value of expected 
dividends taking into account non-vesting conditions.

Siemens Profit Sharing  
The Managing Board of Siemens AG decides annually on the issuance of a new Siemens Profit Sharing tranche and determines the 
targets to be met for the current fiscal year. At fiscal year-end, based on the actual target achievement, the Managing Board of Siemens 
AG decides in its discretion on the amount to be transferred to the Profit-Sharing-Pool; this transfer is limited to a maximum of €400 
million annually. If the Pool amounts to a minimum of €400 million after one or more fiscal years, it will be transferred to eligible 
employees below senior management in full or partially through the grant of free Siemens AG shares. As of September 30, 2017, €300 
million are in the Profit-Sharing-Pool, thereof €46 million have been allocated to Siemens Healthineers. Expense is recognized pro rata 
over the estimated vesting period. 
In November 2017, €100 million were transferred to the Profit-Sharing-Pool, thereof €15 million allocated to Siemens Healthineers; it 
was decided that the Pool amounting to €400 million will be transferred to eligible Siemens Group and Siemens Healthineers’ employees 
in March 2018. 
Jubilee Share Program 
For their 25th and 40th service anniversary, eligible employees receive jubilee shares. There were 432 thousand entitlements to jubilee 
shares outstanding for Siemens Healthineers employees in Germany as of September 30, 2017 (417 thousand and 412 thousand as of 
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively).

Reconciliation to Combined Financial Statements 
Pensions—includes the centrally carried income (expense) related to pension obligations not allocated to the segments as well as the 
centrally managed pension assets and liabilities. 
Siemens Healthineers Real Estate—Siemens Healthineers Real Estate manages Siemens Healthineers’ entire real estate business 
portfolio, operates the properties, and is responsible for building projects and the purchase and sale of real estate. 
Eliminations, Corporate Treasury, Corporate Items, and other items—comprise consolidation of transactions between the segments, 
certain reconciliation and reclassification items and the activities of the Corporate Treasury. Corporate items includes corporate costs, 
such as group managing costs, corporate projects, the amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous business combinations. In 
addition, it includes the business activities and special topics which are not allocated directly to a Segment, because the Managing Board 
does not consider them to be indicative of the Segment’s performance. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for 
example, interest not allocated to segments (referred to as financing interest), interest related to Corporate Treasury activities or resulting 
consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.  
 
Measurement – Segments 
Accounting policies for segment information are generally the same as those used for the Combined Financial Statements. Intersegment 
transactions are based on market prices. 
Profit 
Siemens Healthineers’ Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). 
Siemens Healthineers’ profitability measure of the segments is income before income taxes, financing interest, certain pension costs and 
amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker 
(Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are presented below. 
Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of 
pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in the line item Centrally 
carried pension expense. 
Financing interest, excluded from Profit, is any interest income or expense other than interest income related to receivables from 
customers, from cash allocated to the segments and interest expenses on payables to suppliers. Financing interest is excluded from Profit 
because decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level. 
Amortization expenses of other intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore, income taxes are 
excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. 
This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, Siemens Healthineers Real Estate and (or) have a 
corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.  
Assets 
Management determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments. Its definition 
corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not 
part of Profit; however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments’ Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the 
Combined Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding financing receivables from Siemens Group and tax related assets, since 
the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax 
related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. 
Free cash flow 
Free cash flow constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Free 
Cash Flow on segment level, further excludes financing interest and income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. 
Amortization, depreciation and impairments 
Amortization, depreciation and impairments includes depreciation and impairments of property, plant and equipment as well as 
amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.

Siemens Credit Warehouse 
Siemens Healthineers participates in the factoring program called “Siemens Credit Warehouse”. Siemens Healthineers transfers trade 
receivables to Siemens Group including all relevant collection risks, but is still responsible for the administration of the trade 
receivables.  
Financing 
Siemens Healthineers is included in Siemens Group’s cash pooling and cash management. Siemens Healthineers invests excess short-
term liquidity and is granted overdraft facilities for financing its operating activities.  
Siemens Healthineers has long-term receivables with Siemens Group amounting to €1,365 million as of September 30, 2017 
(September 30, 2016: €0, and September, 30 2015: €0) with maturities in March 2021. 
Siemens Group provides short- and long-term loans to Siemens Healthineers. For additional information, see Note 14 - Debt. 
Other items 
On November 26, 2014, Siemens AG and Siemens Healthcare GmbH concluded a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement 
(“Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsvertrag”). Other items include the payable in relation to this profit and loss transfer in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015. The profits transferred in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted to €815 million, €909 million and 
€806 million, respectively. 
Other material relationships with Siemens Group are described in the following: 
Leasing 
Siemens Healthineers has entered into leasing transactions with Siemens Group mainly relating to IT equipment. As of September 30, 
2017, the outstanding minimum lease payments are €6 million (September 30, 2016: €5 million, and September, 30 2015: €4 
million). The average weighted interest rate in fiscal 2017 is 5.0% (fiscal 2016: 5.0% and fiscal 2015: 4.5%). In addition, several 
operating lease agreements exist between Siemens Healthineers and Siemens Group, in particular with respect to real estate.  
Hedging 
Siemens Healthineers’ hedging activities are performed mainly via Siemens Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG. The consideration is 
based on market rates. The related receivables and payables are mainly disclosed in the line item Other current financial assets and 
Other current financial liabilities in the Combined Financial Statements.  
Collaterals/global letters of support/guarantees 
Siemens Group issues collaterals and credit letters in favor of Siemens Healthineers. The guarantees issued by Siemens Group 
amount to €446 million as of September 30, 2017 (September 30, 2016: €494 million and September 30, 2015: €619 million). 
Transactions with pension schemes and pension entities

for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
F | 53 
Joint Ventures and Associates 
In fiscal 2017 Siemens Healthineers purchased goods and services from Siemens Healthineers joint ventures and associates in an 
amount of €61 million (fiscal 2016: €62 million and fiscal 2015: €72 million). 
Related individuals 
In the periods presented, Siemens Healthineers had no parent company and was not a legal group for Consolidated Financial 
Statement reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS 10. The key management of Siemens Healthineers is therefore defined as 
those persons responsible for the worldwide operating business of Siemens Healthineers, based on their function within Siemens 
Healthineers. These are the members of Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthcare GmbH.  
In addition, Siemens Healthineers is controlled by the ultimate parent, Siemens AG. Therefore, Siemens AG’s Management Board 
and Supervisory Board are deemed key management. Information related to Siemens AG’s Management Board and Supervisory 
Board can be found in Siemens AG’s publicly available financial statements. 
In fiscal 2017, the members of the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers received cash compensation of €4.3 million (fiscal 
2016: €4.1 million and fiscal 2015 €4.2 million). The fair value of stock-based compensation amounts to €1.3 million in fiscal 2017 
(fiscal 2016: €1.3 million and fiscal 2015: €0.7 million). In fiscal 2017, contributions under the BSAV are granted to members of the 
Managing Board totaling €0.6 million (fiscal 2016: €0.6 million and fiscal 2015: €0.7 million). 
Therefore, the total compensation and benefits attributable to the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers amount to €6.2 million in 
fiscal 2017 (fiscal 2016: €6.0 million and fiscal 2015 €5.6 million).  
In fiscal 2017, expense related to share-based payments amounts to €2.2 million (fiscal 2016: €2.7 million and fiscal 2015: 
€0.7 million). 
The Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthcare GmbH consists of 16 members as of September 30, 2017, thereof 8 employees’ 
representatives. In fiscal 2017, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members amounts to €0.1 million (fiscal 2016: 
€0.1 million and fiscal 2015 €0.0 million), whereby most of the shareholder’s representatives in the Supervisory Board waive their 
right to compensation for their activities as members of the Supervisory Board in the periods presented. The employees’ 
representatives on the Supervisory Board (with the exception of those members who are nominated by the labor union) have labor 
contracts with the respective Siemens Healthineers’ entities.  
Siemens Group maintains a directors and officers insurance (“D&O”) for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens 
Healthineers. The insurance policy covers the personal liability risk, in the event that a claim for pecuniary damages is made against 
a member of the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers in conjunction with his or her performance of duties. The related costs are 
charged by Siemens Group to Siemens Healthineers. 
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, no other major transactions took place between Siemens Healthineers and members of the Managing 
Board of Siemens Healthineers or between Siemens Healthineers and members of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthcare 
GmbH. 
Some of the board members hold, or in the last years have held, positions of significant responsibility with other entities. Siemens 
Healthineers has relationships with almost all of these entities in the ordinary course of business.

NOTE 26 Effects from the adoption of IFRS 15 
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. According to the new standard, revenue is 
recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
Siemens Healthineers expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the customer 
obtains control of the goods or services. IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11, Construction Contracts and IAS 18, Revenue as well as related 
interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; early application is permitted. 
Siemens Healthineers will adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning as of October 1, 2017 retrospectively, i.e. the comparable 
period will be presented in accordance with IFRS 15.  
 
The adoption of IFRS 15 as of October 1, 2017 and the preparation of the comparable period for fiscal 2017 confirmed that there will 
be no significant impacts on Siemens Healthineers’ Financial Statements. Retained earnings as of October 1, 2016 will increase by 
€98 million. The increase mainly arises from an earlier recognition of variable consideration components and as transfer of control 
may occur before the transfer of significant risks and rewards for certain goods. As illustrated below, changes in the total amount of 
revenue to be recognized for a customer contract are very limited. Besides, there will be changes to the Statement of Financial 
Position, e.g. separate line items for contract assets and contract liabilities are required, and quantitative and qualitative disclosures 
are added. 
 
The following table illustrates the effects of IFRS 15 to the Combined Statements of Income, if the standard would have already been 
applied in fiscal 2017:

Under IFRS 15 revenue is generally recognized earlier compared to legacy regulations as indicated by the increase of retained earnings 
as of October 1, 2016. However, the effect from revenue acceleration in fiscal year 2017 under IFRS 15 would have been 
overcompensated by a higher effect from revenue acceleration as of October 1, 2016. The difference in revenue of €119 million would 
have been assigned to periods prior to fiscal 2017. 
The following table illustrates the effects of IFRS 15 to the Combined Statements of Financial Position, if the standard would have 
already been applied in fiscal 2017:

F | 56 
According to IFRS 15, once either party to an existing contract (i.e. the customer or Siemens Healthineers) has performed, the 
contract is presented in the financial statements as a Contract asset or a Contract liability, depending on the relationship between 
Siemens Healthineers’ performance and the customer’s payment.  
Therefore mainly two effects from IFRS 15 would have been reflected in the Combined Statements of Financial Position of Siemens 
Healthineers as of September 30, 2017: 
 
Reclassifications due to the newly introduced balance sheet line items Contract assets and Contract liabilities, such as the 
reclassification of advance payments received from the line item Inventories to the line item Contract liabilities or the 
reclassification of customer advances for service business from the line item Other current liabilities to the line item 
Contract liabilities. 
 
An increase of Contract assets and a decrease of Contract liabilities resulting from the earlier revenue recognition under 
IFRS 15. 
 
 
NOTE 27 Subsequent events 
On October 31, 2017, Siemens Healthineers successfully completed the acquisition of Epocal, Inc. (U.S.) from Abbott Laboratories. 
Epocal develops and provides point-of-care blood diagnostic systems for healthcare enterprises and it allows Siemens Healthineers to 
complete its blood gas portfolio. Epocal will be integrated in the Diagnostics segment. Because the process of fair valuing the Epocal 
business has not been completed as of the date of issuance of these Combined Financial Statements, the initial accounting for the 
business combination is incomplete.  
On December 19, 2017, Siemens Healthineers successfully completed the acquisition of all shares in Luxembourg-based FTD 
Investments S.à r.l. Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) provides globally a broad range of diagnostic tests, covering major disease groups. 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. tax reform (the „Tax Cuts and Jobs Act“) was passed into Law. Siemens Healthineers expects that it 
will have a significant one-time impact on the valuation of deferred taxes. 
In the period after the reporting date but prior to the issuance of the Combined Financial Statements, further transactions have 
occurred in connection with the formation as well as the future funding of the Siemens Healthineers Group. This process is still 
ongoing as of the issuance date of the Combined Financial Statements.
