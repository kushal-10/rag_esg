    "10": "Siemens Healthineers is to be separated from Siemens AG and its subsidiaries (“Siemens Group”) in two steps.",
    "11": "In an initial preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separate companies have been transferred to separate legal entities.",
    "12": "In a second step, all companies comprising the Siemens Healthineers business have been or will be bundled under Siemens Healthineers \nAG, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.",
    "13": "According to the European Prospectus Regulation No.",
    "14": "809/2004, as amended (“EPV”), an issuer must present historical financial information covering the latest three fiscal years in its securities prospectus.",
    "15": "Therefore, Siemens Healthineers presents historical financial information for the fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), from October 1, 2015 to \nSeptember 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”) and from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015 (“fiscal 2015”).",
    "16": "According to the European \nProspectus Regulation No.",
    "17": "211/2007 Siemens Healthineers AG, as the issuer, has a “Complex Financial History” as of the share issuance date.",
    "18": "The historical financial information represents the Siemens Healthineers business (hereafter referred to as “Siemens \nHealthineers”) under the control of Siemens AG and managed centrally by the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers.",
    "19": "The Combined Financial Statements consist of Combined Statements of Income, Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income, \nCombined Statements of Financial Position, Combined Statements of Cash Flows, Combined Statements of Changes in Equity and \nNotes to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (collectively referred to hereafter as “Combined Financial Statements”).",

    "26": "Siemens Healthineers’ operations include: \n Imaging, which offers diagnostic imaging products and a broad portfolio of advanced imaging and ultrasound systems and solutions; \n Diagnostics offers products, services and solutions, including a broad array of testing applications, in the areas of laboratory, point of care and molecular diagnostics; \n Advanced Therapies is a supplier of advanced therapy products, services and solutions to the therapy departments of healthcare providers.",
    "27": "Combined Financial Statements \nSiemens Healthineers has prepared these Combined Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”).",
    "28": "Since IFRS provides no guidelines for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, rules given in IAS 8.12 have been used.",
    "29": "IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements and recognized industry practices.",
    "30": "Following IAS 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach has been applied in the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens \nHealthineers.",
    "31": "The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers reflect the Siemens Healthineers entities and the operations assigned to Siemens Healthineers as historically included in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statement of Siemens AG.",
    "32": "Siemens Healthineers applies the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Combined Financial \nStatements as used by the Siemens Healthineers entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusion in the \nIFRS Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG.",
    "33": "Siemens Healthineers \nNotes to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 \nF | 9 \nThe Combined Financial Statements for Siemens Healthineers are derived from the segment reporting for Healthineers as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG.",
    "34": "This segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrally managed functions prior to the legal separation which afterwards are regulated by service level agreements.",
    "35": "In addition, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the scope of Siemens Healthineers, the following combination rules have been applied.",
    "36": "The Management of Siemens Healthineers (as defined in Note 25 – Related party transactions) uses significant judgment in determining these combination rules.",
    "37": "Thus, the Combined Financial Statements presented here do not necessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations that would have occurred if Siemens Healthineers had existed as a separate group in the periods presented.",
    "38": "Scope of combination \nThe scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers for the fiscal years ended September 30, \n2017, September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was determined on economic principles using the common management approach, i.e.",
    "39": "the assets and liabilities which have been managed by the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers throughout the periods presented were included in the scope of combination.",
    "40": "Accordingly, the approach is not based on the legal structure of \nSiemens Healthineers in the periods presented.",
    "41": "However, it is reflective of the target legal structure which will be in place prior to the \nIPO.",
    "42": "Consequently, business operations classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens \nAG during the periods presented and related to the Siemens Healthineers business have been excluded from the scope of combination for all periods presented.",
    "43": "This refers to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the proceeds from the sale of the customer health service business unit to the US-based company Cerner Corp in 2014 and from the sale of the hearing aids business to the investment company EQT in 2015.",
    "44": "For a list of legal entities fully included in the Combined Financial Statements as well as legal entities from which assets and liabilities already under the responsibility of the Managing Board of Siemens Healthineers have been included in the Combined \nFinancial Statements prior to their actual legal transfer, please refer to Note 27 – Scope of combination.",
    "45": "During the period presented in the Combined Financial Statements, the following acquisitions and disposals occurred: \nAcquisitions \nSiemens Healthineers acquired the following businesses which were not material, either individually or in aggregate, and included them in the Combined Financial Statements: \n \nIn March 2016, all shares of Neo New Oncology AG (“NEO”) were acquired.",
    "46": "NEO provides a platform based on hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which facilitates analysis of tumor and therapy-relevant gene segments in an efficient and time-saving multiplex procedure.",
    "47": " \nIn October 2016, all shares of Conworx Technology GmbH (“Conworx”) were acquired.",
    "48": "Conworx offers a complete pointof-care device network along with all associated data management.",
    "49": " \nIn June 2017, Medicalis Corporation (“Medicalis”), a health care information technology company that provides clinical workflow and decision support solution, was acquired.",
    "50": "Disposals \nIn January 2015, Siemens Healthineers sold its microbiology business to Beckman Coulter Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of \nDanaher Corporation.",
    "51": "The activities of the microbiology business include systems for the identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of microorganisms.",
    "52": "The sale resulted in a gain of €64 million which was recognized in the line item Other operating income.",
    "53": "The microbiology assets and liabilities were previously classified as held-for-sale.",
    "54": "Pensions and similar obligations \nThe Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers present the pension obligations and corresponding plan assets allocated to Siemens Healthineers.",
    "55": "The obligations were measured on the basis of expert actuarial valuations.",
    "56": "The pension obligations for active employees as well as for retirees were legally transferred mainly in line with the individual carveouts from the Siemens Group to the newly founded Siemens Healthineers entities.",
    "57": "Therefore, the majority of pension liabilities had legally been transferred either during fiscal 2015 or at the beginning of fiscal 2016.",
    "58": "To ensure comparability throughout all periods presented in the Combined Financial Statements, pension obligations have retrospectively been allocated to Siemens Healthineers for the period prior to the legal carve-outs.",
    "59": "This allocation has been performed based on an allocation key derived from the first actuarial reports after the carve-out.",
    "60": "Pension obligations for retirees in Germany which were transferred to Siemens Healthineers in fiscal 2016 are included in the Combined Financial Statements from the legal transfer date onwards.",
    "61": "Siemens Healthineers \nNotes to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 \nF | 10 \nPlan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal requirements for the major relevant countries.",
    "62": "Where the respective employee has a right to claim a minimal funding or the plan assets were already allocated to individual employee accounts, plan assets have been retrospectively allocated to Siemens Healthineers for the period prior to the legal transfer of the assets.",
    "63": "Due to the fact that the legal transfer of these plan assets has not yet been completed, the actual amounts of the plan assets to be transferred may differ from the plan assets presented in the Combined Financial Statements.",

    "130": "Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.",
    "131": "The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management.",
