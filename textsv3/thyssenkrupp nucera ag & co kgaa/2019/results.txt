IPO, are presented in the relevant sections of the notes, in particular Summary of significant accounting policies and critical 
accounting estimates (cf. Note 2), Related Party (cf. Note 21) and Management Incentive Plans (cf. Note 28). 
According to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980, an issuer must present historical financial information covering 
the latest three fiscal years in its securities prospectus. This requires the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for 
thyssenkrupp nucera Group for the fiscal years from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, from October 1, 2020 to

September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively 
.  
 
The Management Board of thyssenkrupp nucera management 
these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
This set of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group was authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
directors on January 9, 2023. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of thyssenkrupp nucera Group have been prepared in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The term IFRS also includes the International 
Accounting Standards (IAS), the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations 

 
 
7 
 
Committee (IFRS IC) or its predecessor the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and those of 
the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). Further information on the underlying accounting policies can be found 
in Note 2.  
This set of Consolidated Financial Statements has been prepared on a voluntary basis. The Company is and historically has 
been exempt from the obligation to prepare and disclose consolidated annual financial statements and group management 
reports in accordance with section 291 (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) due to the fact that 
information historically has been included as part of the published consolidated financial statements of tk AG.  
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial 
instruments, financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.  
The annual financial statements of companies included in the Group have been prepared using uniform accounting policies 
summarized in Note 2. The reporting date for the individual financial statements of companies included in the Group is the 
same as the reporting date for the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 thousand), 
except when otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. 
The Group has prepared the financial statements on the basis that it will continue to operate as a going concern. 
Based on a general service agreement, tk Group provided the Group with general and administrative services such as tax, 
legal, controlling, accounting, IT or insurance. The general service agreement also covered operational functions such as 
construction management, engineering, project management, quality management and R&D. In conjunction with the IPO, the 
terms of the general service agreement between tk Group and the Group have been re-negotiated. Beginning from October 1, 
2021 additional services historically not covered by the general service agreement, especially governance functions like internal 
audit services, tax statement preparation and handling as well as compliance services are provided to the Group. As such, 
costs historically charged to the Group differ from the costs that have been charged to the Group beginning from October 1, 
2021 based on the re-negotiated terms. Therefore, the costs for service contracts for the twelve-month period ended 
September 30, 2022 are not comparable to prior periods, since additional services have been agreed. In addition, the Group 
is also establishing new functions in conjunction with the IPO which will further increase the cost base. Therefore, the cost 
structure as reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements may not be representative for the future in this regard. Further 
information on related party transactions is provided in Note 20. 
The Group is a leading electrolysis technology provider to its global customers by share of installed capacity. Its business 
consists of: (i) the design, engineering and procurement of electrolysis technologies and the plants into which they are

representing a large portion of these customers. Most customers' CA plants are integrated production units which, in addition 
to the CA electrolysis plant, contain the entire vinyl production chain. The Group's CA customers are linked to the polyurethane 
industry as well as the polycarbonate industry and other organic and inorganic chemical synthesis applications. The related 
projects are customer-specific and long-term, with an average term of two to three years.  
 
The product group
 covers the construction of new plants involving the AW technology used for the production 
of green hydrogen. There is a wide range of AW electrolysis technology customers across industry and energy sectors, including 
the power-to-x markets, as well as operators of refineries, power utility companies, steel manufacturers and project developers. 
The related projects are customer-specific and long-term, with an average term of two to three years.  
 
The product group 
 covers a comprehensive portfolio of aftermarket services for its technologies in support of its goal 
of entering into long-term partnerships with its customers. Historically, Service focused primarily on the maintenance and

operation of its CA technologies. AW technology related Service projects are expected to grow in the future once the AWE plants 
come into operation and the ordinary service cycle of electrolysis technologies begins. The Group, in partnership with IDN, a 
critical supplier and procurer to the Group, offers several maintenance and operation related services to its customers:  
 
Spare parts supply and management: The Group offers certified and carefully-tested spare parts, including component 
parts and electrolysis cells, to its customers when components require replacement. The sale of its spare parts is 
supported by its proven supply chains to minimize delivery time. 
 
Refurbishments and revamps: To improve plant performance, the Group offers a range of services that can be 
provided on-site which significantly reduce the energy consumed per metric ton of sodium hydroxide. General plant 
improvements, refurbishments and revamps can be carried out for an entire cell room or individual electrolysers. 
Similar to the product group New Build, projects are customer-specific and in case of revamps long-term, with an 
average term of two to three years. 
 
Digital plant monitoring and optimization: The Group uses third party data tools to measure and analyse plant operating 
data on a continuous basis to ensure maximum safety and operation. By transmitting actual operating data, regular 
reports are generated, including all relevant key performance indicators, benchmarks and recommendations. The data 
that is collected is then analysed by the Group's service specialists for the purposes of predictive maintenance and 
troubleshooting, optimization and performance improvement across its customers' plants. The Group also offers digital 
twins of electrolysers, advanced process control and remote expert support. 
 
Consulting: The Group has dedicated consulting specialists to support its customers' day-to-day plant operations. The 
consulting service offers regular consultation visits to benchmark customer plants and check them against the latest 
technical developments.  
 
From its headquarters in Germany and facilities in China, Japan, Italy, the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia, the Group 
is able to provide fast and comprehensive technology services to its customers alongside its product group portfolio. Further 
provided in Note 21.  
 
The use of hydrogen is a key lever to decarbonize a wide range of carbon-emitting activities. The Group sees a continued strong 
political willingness to support green hydrogen solutions and AWE capacity expansion, providing a setting for increased 
customer demand. The high demand for hydrogen solutions will drive growth in water electrolysis. The need for decarbonisation 
results also from climate change effects. Risks and rewards are considered in our estimations regarding accounting and 
recoverability of non-current assets and provisions. Judgement and estimations

statements of the Company and the entities which are 
directly or indirectly controlled by the Company (subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:  
 
Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); 
 
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; 
 
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Typically, control is assumed if the Group possesses more than half of the voting rights. Further information on the scope of 
consolidation is provided in Note 3.  
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the carrying amounts of 
subsidiaries against their attributable equity. On acquisition, the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured 
at their fair values at the date of the acquisition. A contingent liability is recognised at their fair values at the date of the 
acquisition, if it is a present obligation that arises from past events and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
All significant intercompany transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented separately in the balance sheet.

The consolidated statement of income is prepared based on the cost-of-sales method by classifying expenses according to 
their function. 
Cost of sales includes the engineering and purchase costs incurred to generate the sales. In addition to direct material costs, 
procurement and construction services, non-staff overheads and personnel costs, which represent the majority of cost of sales, 
cost of sales also includes project and non-project-related indirect costs, including depreciation and amortization and warranty 
costs. 
Research and development cost includes expenses in connection with research and development activities not eligible for 
capitalization and other costs related to the functional area of research and development. 
Selling expenses includes personnel, service and material costs related to the business development and sales process, 
particularly the preparation of any New Build or Service order proposals, including marketing and other costs related to the 
functional area of sales. 
General and administrative expenses include costs incurred in operating and administering the business and consist primarily 
of expenses for salaries of non-project-related personnel and headquarters expenses and other costs related to the functional 
area of general administration. 
The Group uses the indirect method to prepare its consolidated statement of cashflows. Net income or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, 
and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.  
In previous fiscal years cash pooling activities with tk Group have been presented within cash flow from financing activities. As 
of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Group presents cash pooling activities within cash flow from investing 
activities for the current fiscal year and the comparable periods.  The Group has a continuously net receivable due to excess 
cash that corresponds with the character of a mid-term investment. Moreover, in the context of the planned IPO and the 
associated anticipated replacement of the cash pool agreement, the presentation within cash flow from investing activities is 
intended to ensure more meaningful information and better comparability in the light of the investment strategy selected for 
excess cash in the future. 
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current/non-current classification. 
Assets and liabilities are classified by maturity. An asset is current when it is (i) expected to be realised or intended to be sold 
or consumed in the normal operating cycle, (ii) held primarily for the purpose of trading, (iii) expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting period or (iv) Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to 
settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when (i) it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle, (ii) it is held primarily for the purpose of 
trading, (iii) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or (iv) there is no unconditional right to defer 
the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The Group classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.  
thyssenkrupp nucera 
is presented in euro 
, which is also the C
currency. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each 
entity are measured using that functional currency. 
t rates 
at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange prevailing at 
the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates of the respective reporting 
period. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are capitalized at cost and amortized depending on their estimated useful lives. Useful 
lives are examined on an annual basis and adjusted when applicable on a prospective basis. The amortization expense of 
intangible assets is primarily included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income.

Goodwill is stated at cost and tested for impairment annually or on such other occasions that events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill impairment losses are included in other expenses, if any.  
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capitalized production costs 
for self-constructed assets include costs of material, direct labour, allocable material and manufacturing overhead. 
Administrative costs are capitalized only if such costs are directly related to production. Maintenance and repair costs (day-to-
day servicing) are expensed as incurred. 
Fixtures and equipment are depreciated over the customary useful life using the straight-line method. The following useful lives 
are used as a basis for calculating depreciation: 
 
Useful lives 
Buildings 
4 to 50 years 
Technical machinery and equipment 
4 to 25 years 
Factory and office equipment 
3 to 15 years 
 
 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets, property, plant and equipment to 
determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. If such indicator does exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit to which the asset 
belongs.  
At thyssenkrupp nucera Group the Cash Generating Units are represented by the individual legal entities which are located in 
Germany, Italy, China, Japan, the USA, Saudi Arabia and Australia and are operating in different geographical regions. The 
various legal entities operate with high autonomy and generate cash inflows that are largely independent of other legal entities 
of thyssenkrupp nucera Group. 
Goodwill arising from acquisitions is allocated to the Cash Generating Units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the acquisition. These Cash Generating Units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit that carries a goodwill is tested for 

 
 
11 
 
impairment annually as of September 30, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it 
might be impaired. For more details refer to Note 4. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized as an expense immediately. 
In case of impairment losses related to Cash Generating Units that contain goodwill the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the Cash Generating Unit is reduced first. If the amount of impairment losses exceeds the carrying amount of 
goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to the remaining non-current assets of the Cash Generating Unit to 
reduce their carrying amounts accordingly. The carrying amount of an asset is not reduced below the highest of its fair value 
less costs of disposal (if measurable), its value in use (if determinable) and zero. The amount of the impairment loss that would 
otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the Cash Generating Unit. 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (Cash Generating Unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount. The revised amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (Cash Generating Unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognized as income immediately. However, impairment losses of goodwill may not be reversed. 
A contract constitutes a lease if the contract conveys the lessee  
- 
the right to control the use of an identified asset (the leased asset) 
- 
for a specific period 
- 
in exchange for a consideration. 
The Group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the statement of financial position an asset for the right of use 
of the leased assets and a liability for the lease payment commitments at present value. These are primarily rentals of property 
and buildings, transport vehicles, technical equipment and machinery, other plants and operating and office equipment. The 
right of use assets reported under property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. Payments for non-lease components are not included in the determination of the lease liability. The lease 
liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the time the asset is 
made available for use. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined, 
wing rate. The determination of the interest rate is based on 
the assumption that an adequate amount of funds will be raised over an adequate period of time, taking into account the 
respective currency area. 
The lease liabilities include the following lease payments: 
- 
Fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor, 
- 
variable lease payments that are based on an index or an interest rate, 
- 
expected amounts to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, 
- 
the exercise price of a purchase option, if the exercise is reasonably certain and 
- 
payment of penalties for the termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate 
the lease. 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which are comprised as follows: 
- 
Lease liability, 
- 
lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, 
- 
initial direct costs and 
- 
dismantling obligations. 
Subsequent measurement is performed at amortized cost. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. If the lease agreement contains reasonably certain 
purchase options, the right of use is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The following useful lives are used 
as a basis for calculating depreciation: 
 
Useful lives 
Buildings 
1 to 5 years 
Other equipment, factory and office equipment 
1 to 4 years 
 

 
 
12 
 
In subsequent measurement, the lease liability is compounded, and the corresponding interest expense is recognized in the 
financial result. The lease payments made reduce the carrying amount of the lease liability. 
In accordance with the recognition exemptions, low-value leases and short-term leases (less than twelve months) are 
recognized in the statement of income. The Group has identified certain asset classes (e.g., PCs, telephones, printers, copiers) 
which regularly contain leased assets of low value. Outside these asset classes, only leased assets with a value of 
 
thousand are classified as low-value leased assets. In general, IFRS 16 regulations are not applied to leases of intangible 
assets. For contracts including a non-lease component as well as a lease component, each lease component must be 
accounted for separately from non-lease component as a lease. The lessee must allocate the contractually agreed-upon 
payment to the separate lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the 
aggregated standalone selling price of the non-lease components.  
The term of the lease is determined based on the non-cancellable lease term together with any periods covered by an option 
to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised. Especially real estate leases contain extension and termination options to offer greater 
operational flexibility to the Group. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances are considered that provide an 
economic incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise termination options.  
Inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition/manufacturing cost or net realizable value. In general, inventories are valued 
using the weighted average cost method. Manufacturing cost includes direct material, labour and allocable material and 
manufacturing overhead based on normal operating capacity. Work in progress refers to costs incurred (e.g., direct material 
purchased from suppliers) on unfinished spare sparts and single elements which are in progress of refinement. 
WE, 
and large-scale Service projects, for which revenue is recognized over time. If the performance obligations fulfilled by the Group 
exceed the payments received or due from its customers, contract assets are recognized in the statement of financial position 
on a net basis insofar as the right to receive payment from the customer is still conditional. Unconditional rights to receive 
payment are recognized under trade accounts receivable and from this point payment automatically becomes due with the 
passage of time. If the payments received or due from the customer exceed the performance obligations fulfilled, contract 
liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis. 
As contract assets relate to construction contracts and long-term service agreements in progress, that have not yet been 
invoiced, they are subject to similar credit risks as trade receivables for the same types of contracts. Therefore, the expected 
loss rates of trade receivables are applied to the impairment of contract assets.  
A financial instrument is any contract that at the same time gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the Group becomes a contracting party 
to the financial instrument. In cases where trade date and settlement date do not coincide, for non-derivative financial 
instruments the settlement date is used for initial recognition or derecognition, while for derivatives the trade date is used. 
Financial instruments stated as financial assets or financial liabilities are generally not offset; they are only offset when a legal 
right to set off exists at that time and settlement on a net basis is intended. 
In particular, financial assets include trade accounts receivable, cash, cash equivalents and time deposits, derivative financial 
assets, as well as debt instruments. Trade accounts receivable are initially measured at the transaction price. Other financial 
assets are initially recognized at fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets, which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss in future periods. The fair values recognized on the balance 
sheet usually reflect the market prices of the financial assets. 
 
financial assets.  
If a debt instrument is held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and if the cash flows are solely payments of 
principal and interest, the instrument is recognized at amortized cost. At the Group this mainly concerns trade accounts 
receivable, contract assets, and cash, cash equivalents and time deposits. 

 
 
13 
 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also recognized at fair value in profit or loss.  
Debt instruments, trade accounts receivable and contract assets recognized at amortized cost are measured according to the 
expected loss model. The expected credit loss is generally calculated by multiplying the three parameters carrying value of the 
financial asset, probability of default, and loss given default using forward-looking information. The Group applies the simplified 
impairment model under IFRS 9, and reports lifetime expected losses for all trade accounts receivable and contract assets. 
The Group has established a model to determine the expected credit loss, in particular to determine the expected default rates 
for trade accounts receivable. The expected default rates are determined mainly on the basis of external credit information and 
ratings for each counterparty. If no rating information is available at counterparty level, an assessment is made based on the 
average probability of default for each segment plus an appropriate risk premium. Consideration is also given to the respective 
business model, customer groups, and economic environment of the region.  
Financial assets are fully or partially written-off on the basis of individual allowances if it is reasonable to assume that they can 
no longer be fully realized, e.g., because the due date has long passed, or owing to insolvency or similar proceedings. Credit 
default is generally assumed after 360 days. 
Cash, cash equivalents and time deposits include cash on hand and demand deposits as well as financial assets that are readily 
convertible to cash and which are only subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash, cash equivalents and time 
deposits are measured at amortized cost. 
Financial liabilities are liabilities that must be settled in cash or other financial assets. Financial liabilities are initially carried at 
fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial liabilities, which are not carried 
at fair value through profit or loss in future periods. 
Trade accounts payable and other non-derivative financial liabilities are in general measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on redemption or settlement, are periodically accrued 
using the effective interest 
period in which they were incurred. 
Derivative financial instruments, solely foreign currency forward contracts, are used generally to reduce the currency risk. Such 
derivatives must be accounted for separately, are measured initially and subsequently at fair value. If the fair value is positive, 
they are recognized as financial assets. If the fair value is negative, they are recognized as financial liabilities. If they do not 
qualify for hedge accounting, they are recognized at fair value in profit or loss, and gains or losses due to fluctuations in fair 
value are recognized immediately in profit or loss.  
Hedging relationships are solely used to hedge foreign currency risks of firm commitments, future receivables and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currency. In the case of cash flow hedges, the fluctuations in fair value are divided into an effective and 
an ineffective portion. The effective portion of fluctuations in fair value as well as hedging costs (forward element and currency 
basis spread) in connection with designated foreign currency derivatives is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
Reclassification to profit or loss takes place when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
The presentation of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting in the 
statement of income follows the presentation of the hedged items. For foreign currency contracts used to hedge sales risks, 
they are presented under net sales. For hedging instruments used to hedge procurement risks, they are presented under cost 
of sales, and for hedging instruments used to hedge financing risks they are presented under financial income/expense. 
If a hedging relationship does not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with the conditions under IFRS 9 
or hedge accounting is economically not reasonable, the derivative financial instrument is recognized as a derivative that does 
not qualify for hedge accounting. The resulting impact on profit and loss from derivative financial instruments that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are recognized either in other income or other expenses. 
Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made regarding the presentation of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. In consequence, changes in fair value are no longer presented within Sales or Cost of sales. Instead, the effect is

The Group made the accounting policy choice under 
 to accrue qualified transaction 
costs incurred in connection with services relating to the preparation of the IPO instead of directly offsetting such transaction 
costs against equity. Upon the occurrence of the IPO the accrued transaction cost will be offset against equity. Qualified 
transaction costs are based on a reasonable estimate of the number of new shares that will be issued in the IPO. In this context, 
there is uncertainty and future changes in such assumptions may require adjustments to the amount of accrued qualified 
transaction costs already recognized. 
More information about financial instruments is provided in Note 19. 
Income taxes comprise all current and deferred taxes based on taxable profit. They are calculated by taking into account the 
statutory provisions applying in the countries in which the Group operates. Interest and other surcharges in connection with 
income taxes are not recognized in income tax expense.  
In this connection management judgments are required which may differ from the interpretations of local tax authorities. If this 
results in changes to income taxes from the past, these are reported in the period in which sufficient information is available 
for an adjustment. Generally, income taxes are calculated on the basis of the taxable profits, temporary difference reported for 
the fiscal year and the tax losses carried forward. Current income taxes are recognized in the amount in which it is assumed 
they will be paid to the tax authorities in the future. Current income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity.  
Deferred taxes are accounted for based on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the 
statement of financial position and its tax basis. Additionally, deferred tax assets are derived from unused tax losses carried 
forward and credits. Where deferred tax assets occur, they are measured and adjusted according to an assessment of their 
future recoverability using forecast calculations and realizable tax strategies. Deferred taxes are calculated at the enacted or 
substantially enacted tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.  
Deferred taxes relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities raised by the same taxation authority on the same taxable 
entity by reference to their maturity.  
recognized in the consolidated statement of income of the period and that are not resulting from capital transactions with the 
owners. Cumulative other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and 
losses on derivative financial instruments in cash flow hedging, hedging costs in connection with designated foreign currency 
derivatives. Remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are reported in cumulative other comprehensive income in 
the period that they are recognized as other comprehensive income.

the projected unit credit method as of the balance sheet date.  
In Germany, the company of the Group 
-
employer plan is defined benefit by nature but due to insufficient information regarding the attributable asset portion the plan 
was accounted as a defined contribution plan. However, the legally required pension indexation is not expected to be covered 
by the pension fund but needs to be paid by the company directly. Accordingly, the proportioned pension indexation share is 
accounted as defined benefit plan. As far as the fair value of plan assets related to pensions or similar obligations exceeds the 
corresponding obligation, the recognition of an asset in respect to such surplus is limited. As far as in connection with plan 
assets minimum funding requirements related to past service exist, an additional liability may need to be recognized in case 
the economic benefit of a surplus  already taking into account the contributions to be made in respect of the minimum funding 
requirements  is limited. The limit is determined by the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in 
future contributions to the plan asset (asset ceiling).  
With the exception of net interest, all income and expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in income/(loss) 
from operations. Net interest included in net periodic pension cost is recognized in net financial income/(expense) in the Group
statement of income.

e/(loss) from 
operations as incurred. 
The effects of remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are recognized in other comprehensive income and reported 
in cumulative other comprehensive income. They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets and changes 
in the effects of asset ceiling excluding amounts already included in net interest. Deferred taxes relating to remeasurements 
are also recognized in other comprehensive income. 
The Group continues to recognize accrued pension liabilities for plan participants in cases where the pension liability is legally 
transferred but the Group is not released from all risks associated with the defined benefit plans subsequent to the legal transfer 
(only relevant for accrued pension liabilities for members of the Management Board of thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG, 
cf. Note 12). In such cases any cash payment made in connection with the legal transfer of the defined benefit plans as well 
as future compensation payments regarding current service costs are accounted for as a reimbursement right. As such it is 
initially recognized at fair value to the extent such reimbursement right does not exceed the accrued pension liability 
(remeasurement through other comprehensive income) and presented as other non-financial (non-current) asset. The 
reimbursement right does not qualify as a plan asset and is therefore presented as a separate asset, rather than as a deduction 
from the accrued pension liability. The reimbursement right is accounted for like a plan asset, i.e., (i) recognizing interest arising 
from passage of time as interest income and (ii) any difference to the actual return or due to changes of the impact of asset 
ceiling in other comprehensive income.  
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model. That cost is recognized in employee benefits expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity 
(additional paid in capital), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions 
ket 
performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without 
an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair 
value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. 
A liability is recognized for the fair value of cash-settled transactions. The fair value is measured initially and at each reporting 
date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in employee benefits expenses. The fair 
value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The approach used to 
account for vesting conditions when measuring equity-settled transactions also applies to cash-settled transactions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which will result in a probable 
outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized represents best estimate of the 
settlement amount of the present obligation as of the balance sheet date. Expected reimbursements of third parties are not 
offset but recorded as a separate asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursements will be received. Where the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a market rate. 
A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical 
warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. Expenses related to the fulfilment 
of warranties qualify as subsequent contract costs and are therefore recognized in cost of sales. The reversal of such provisions 
is vice versa recognized in cost of sales.  
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when the included distinct performance obligations, i.e., the distinct 
goods or services promised in the contract, are transferred to the customer. Transfer takes place when the customer obtains 
control of the promised goods or services. This is generally the case when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and 
obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the transferred goods or services. Revenue from contracts with customers 

 
 
16 
 
corresponds to the transaction price. The transaction price includes in rare cases variable consideration only to the extent it is 
highly probable that actual occurrence of the variable consideration will not result in a significant revenue reversal. Variable 
consideration can include volume discounts, delay penalties, early completion incentives, or credits in connection with bonus 
agreements. The transaction price is not adjusted for a financing component, mainly because the period between the transfer 
of goods and services and the date of payment by the customer is generally less than twelve months. 
Depending on the nature of the transfer of the underlying good or service, the following revenue recognition methods are 
applied: 
 
Recognition of revenue at a point in time is generally applied in the Service product group (cf. Note 1.3) with respect to the 
delivery of standard spare parts and single elements (finished goods and merchandise). Revenue for short-term service 
contracts is recognized at a point in time.  
Revenue from the sale and delivery of goods and short-term services is recognized at the point in time at which control is 
transferred to the customer. The time of transfer of control is determined partly on the basis of the delivery clauses (incoterms) 
agreed with the customer.  
Recognition of revenue over time is generally applied to all construction contracts, including New Build CA and New Build AWE 
contracts (cf. Note 1.3). The method is also applied to service contracts involving plant refurbishment, revamps or other long-
term contracts in our Service product group (cf. Note 1.3). Revenue is recognized over time, whereas the progress of satisfying 
the performance obligations of construction and service contracts is measured by using the input method based on contract 
costs. The progress is determined by the ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract 
costs as of the reporting date.  
To demonstrate that the transfer of goods is progressive, the following required cumulative criteria must be fulfilled to recognize 
revenue over time:  
- 
the goods sold have no alternative use, and  
- 
enforceable right to payment (corresponding to costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit margin) for the work performed 
to date exists, in the event of early termination for convenience by the customer. 
This method is applicable for plant engineering projects (engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning), as the 
constructed assets are highly customized. 
In case of onerous contracts, the total anticipated losses, i.e., the amount of unavoidable costs exceeding the transaction price, 
is recognized within current other provisions. 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Results from research activities are used to initiate, plan and execute development 
projects. 
Development costs are capitalized if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, it is intended to complete 
the intangible asset, the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits, the attributable expenditure can be 
measured reliably, and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Other development costs are expensed 
as incurred. Capitalized development costs of completed projects are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and 
impairment losses. 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis 
over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.  
The Group spends significant amounts for research activities in particular related to green hydrogen technology and receives 
for such activities grants from the government. Grants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Undiluted or basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the result attributable to the holders of registered shares by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The calculation is adjusted for transactions that change 
the number of shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources for all periods presented even if some of such 
transactions happened after the year-end but before the approval of the financial statements. Diluted earnings per share equal 
undiluted or basic earnings per share as no dilutive instruments exist. 
Segment reporting is prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 based on the management approach. This approach corresponds to 
the internal organisational and management structure as well as reporting to the Management Board as the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM). At thyssenkrupp nucera Group the operating segments are represented by the individual legal entities 
and their respective country of incorporation. The legal entities in the USA, Saudi Arabia and Australia are not reportable 
individually due to their size and therefore combined as all other segments and disclosed in the segment Rest of World (RoW) 
(cf. Note 21).  
Certain line items on the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated statement of income have been combined. These 
items are disclosed separately in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
In general, the Group classifies assets and liabilities as current when they are expected to be realized or settled within twelve 
months after the balance sheet date or held primarily for the purpose of trading. Group companies that have operating cycles 
longer than twelve months classify assets and l
normal operating cycle.  
The preparation of the Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. All estimates and 
position and statement of income; they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. This applies in particular with regard to the possible 
impacts of the current global coronavirus pandemic. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
Accounting estimates and judgments made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements are relevant for the following issues:  
 
The Group performs goodwill impairment testing at least annually and whenever any impairment indicators are present. If there 
is an indication, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has to be estimated as the greater of the fair value less 
costs to sell and the value in use. The determination of the value in use involves estimates related to the projection and 
discounting of future cash flows (cf. Note 4). The Group's growth strategy is dependent upon market acceptance of, as well as 
enhancements to, its AWE products. A mass market for the Group's AWE products and technologies may take longer to develop 
than anticipated or may never develop because the green hydrogen production industry is an emerging market and there can 
be no certainty that the Group will achieve or maintain commercialisation of its products and technologies. Although 
management believes the assumptions used to calculate recoverable amounts are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in 
these assumptions could result in impairment charges to goodwill which could adversely affect the future financial position and 
operating results.  
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that the carrying amounts of its property, plant 
and equipment or intangible assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing the value 
in use, discounted future cash flows from the related assets have to be determined. The recoverable amount is generally 
determined on cash-generating unit level as individual assets typically do not generate independent cash flows. Estimating the 
discounted future cash flows involves significant assumptions, including particularly those regarding future sale prices and sale 
volumes, costs and discount rates (cf. Note 4 and 5). Although management believes that its estimates of the relevant expected 
useful lives, its assumptions concerning the economic environment and developments in the industries in which the Group 
operates and its estimations of the discounted future cash flows are appropriate, changes in the assumptions or circumstances 

 
 
18 
 
could require changes in the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment charges in the future or to reversal of 
impairments if the trends identified by management reverse or the assumptions or estimates prove incorrect. 
Some leases contain extension and termination options. These contractual conditions offer the Group as lessee maximum 
operational flexibility. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances are considered that provide an economic 
incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise termination options. In determining the lease term, possible options are 
only taken into account if they are considered reasonably certain. Where facts and circumstances change over time, exercise 
of the option is re-assessed.  
The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the estimation of the probability of a future outflow of 
resources as well as empirical values and the circumstances known at the reporting date. This means that the actual later 
outflow of resources may differ from the other provisions, cf. also the remarks under Note 13. 
The Group accounts for New Build CA and New Build AWE contracts as well as specific service contracts, e.g., relating to plant 
refurbishment or revamps, as construction contracts. Revenue is recognized over time, whereas the progress of satisfying the 
performance obligations of construction and service contracts is measured by using the input method based on contract costs. 
This method requires accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the methodology to 
determine contract progress, significant estimates include total contract costs, remaining costs to completion, total contract 
revenues, contract risks and other judgments. Total expected revenue and cost on a contract reflect man
best estimate of the probable future benefits and obligations associated with the contract. Management continually reviews all 
estimates involved in such construction contracts and adjusts them as necessary. 
In rare cases the Group enters into contracts, typically New Build projects, including a minor variable consideration element. 
Such variable consideration is estimated at the inception of the contract, reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as 
necessary. 
The recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax receivables and liabilities depend on management estimates of 
tax uncertainties and future business performance. This includes both the interpretation of existing tax regulations and the 
testing of deferred tax assets for impairment. These estimates are adjusted when there is sufficient evidence indicating an 
adjustment would be required. 
The Group accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with actuarial valuations. These valuations 
rely on statistical analyses and other factors in order to anticipate future events. These factors include key actuarial assumptions 
including the discount rate, expected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These actuarial 
assumptions may differ materially from actual developments due to changing market and economic conditions and therefore 
result in a significant change in postretirement employee benefit obligations, of equity and the related future expense (cf. Note 
12 for further information). 
The Group companies are parties to litigations related to a number of legal matters as further described in Note 18. The outcome 
of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management, with 
the support of both in-house legal counsel as well as external legal counsel, regularly analyses current information about these 
matters and provides provisions for probable contingent losses, including the estimate of legal expense to resolve the matters. 
In making the decision regarding the need for loss provisions, management considers the degree of probability of an 
unfavourable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing of a suit or formal 
assertion of a claim against the Group companies or the disclosure of any such suit or assertions, does not automatically 
indicate that a provision of a loss may be appropriate.

parts of the economy, as the war can indirectly lead to a further strong increase in inflation rates with negative impact on 
consumer and investment confidence, also due to further interest rate hikes as central banks might respond to inflation with a 
clear tightening of monetary policy. In many countries, inflation has become a central concern. In some advanced economies, 
including the United States and some European countries, it has reached its highest level in more than 40 years. 
The Group currently has only small, short-term service contracts with customers in Russia or Ukraine. Consequently, the

from such contracts as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore there is no significant direct impact 
of the recent developments on the Group.  
At the present time, the specific extent of the indirect consequences of the war in Ukraine on the business development of the 
Group  such as uncertainty in supply chain including increased prices of raw materials and their processing costs as well as 
energy prices  remains associated with high uncertainties. Even though the Group has implemented ongoing risk mitigation 
actions  such as inventory build-up for selected materials, intense vendor management and refined price escalation clauses 
for future projects  it cannot be ruled out that the economic implications of this crisis will have an imp
business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 
The continuing high level of inflation and the risk of changes in interest rates are continuously monitored by the Group regarding 
its potential impact on significant estimates. Therefore, the Group performed an impairment test of its goodwill for all segments 
and an assessment of its expected credit loss model. The Group did not identify any need for adjustments. 
Due to the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus pandemic, especially potential lockdown restrictions as implemented 
in China recently, further impacts on the results of operations and financial position of the company cannot be ruled out. Future 
economic development will depend critically on the course of the crisis, including whether the new virus strains prove vulnerable 
to vaccines or lead to the prolongation of the pandemic situation, the effectiveness of political measures to limit the ongoing 
economic impact, the development of financial conditions, and the adaptability of the economy. Thus, the uncertainties 
associated with the pandemic by limiting economic activity and public life will continue to make for a challenging market 
he concrete financial impact due to the agile pandemic 
situation. Nevertheless, based on the experience gained since spring 2020 the Group is prepared for this situation in terms of 
organization and processes and expects further normalization over time.

The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) 
is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients:  
 
A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required by the reform, 
to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate of interest  
 
Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation without the 
hedging relationship being discontinued  
Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR 
instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) of all segments. Under IFRS, the recoverable amount of a CGU is 
the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For year-end reporting, the recoverable amount for each CGU 
was determined by calculating the value in use based on the discounted cash flow method. The cashflows were derived from 
financial budgets covering a three-year plan period (the 
 prepared by the local management of the legal entities 
and approved by thyssenkrupp nucera 
plan 
periods are extrapolated based on the third budget year using business-specific assumptions. The last planning period is used 
to calculate the perpetuity based on a long-term growth rate of 1.3 % as of September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: 1.3 %, 
September 30, 2020: 1.3 %). The weighted average cost of capital discount rate is based on a risk-free interest rate of 1.5 % 
as of September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: 0.1 %, September 30, 2020: 0.0 %) and a market risk premium of 7.5% as 
of September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: 7.5 %, September 30, 2020: 7.5 %). The cost of debt and the capital structure 
is derived individually from the relevant peer group. In addition, CGU specific tax rates and country risk premiums are used. To 
discount cash flows after-tax discount rates are applied.  
Based on an iterative calculation the following pre-tax discount rates are derived from the after-tax discount rates:

For all CGUs with goodwill, the recoverable amount is at least 504% higher than the carrying amount as of September 30, 2022. 
The applied valuation model takes forward-looking information derived from current macroeconomic conditions into account 
(e.g., increase in material and personnel costs in the short-term; a degressive increase in material and personnel costs in the 
mid-term). Under consideration of the current macroeconomic conditions, increasing interest rates have been considered as 
part of a sensitivity analysis. In accordance with the aforementioned valuation model, critical goodwill does not exist.

of the inventories over time is mainly 
caused by the nature and status of various projects as the majority of the purchases is related to contracted orders. Raw 
materials are used for both, long-term constructions contracts, esp. New Built projects, and short-term Service projects. The 
raw material level is mainly driven by procurement volumes, raw material prices and the consumption of raw material especially 
in long-term construction projects, and therefore fluctuates over time. The increase of work in progress in fiscal years 
2021/2022 is mainly driven by postponed processing of major element orders upon 
delivery due to delays in project execution and therefore later customer acceptance. 
In the reporting period ended September 30, 2022, 54 thousand (September 30, 2021
217 thousand, September 30, 
1,768 thousand) of inventory write-downs have been recognized as an expense. In the reporting period ended

is mainly caused by the nature and status of various projects. The Group typically obtains significant prepayments in connection 
with New Build and large-scale Service projects having an average term of two to three years at inception of each project. The 
significant increase in contract liabilities is driven by new projects which are in an early stage and are turning into sales over 
time.  
Contract assets decreased by 5,601 thousand in the fiscal year 2021/2022 (2020/2021: increase of 12,008 thousand) 
primarily due to a decrease (2020/2021: increase) in unbilled revenue related to the satisfaction of performance obligations, 
in excess of the amounts billed to customers for contracts that were in a contract asset position.  
Contract liabilities increased 
93,958 thousand in the fiscal year 2021/2022 (decreased 15,084 thousand in the fiscal year 
2020/2021) primarily due to an increase (2020/2021: decrease) of prepayments related to new major projects, in excess of 
revenue recognized from satisfied performance obligations for contracts that were in a contract liability position. 
In the course of the 2021/2022 
55,261 thousand (2020/2021
55,999 thousand, 
) reflected in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the fiscal year were recognized. 
contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. The total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were 
unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of September 30, 2022 comprised 1,249,159 thousand (September 30, 2021
332,737 
thousand, 
). This amount mostly comprises obligations to construction contracts, 
including New Build CA and New Build AWE contracts as well as service contracts involving plant refurbishment, revamps or 
other long-term contracts in our Service product group, as the respective contracts typically have durations of one or multiple 
years. The significant increase in the remaining performance obligation is mainly driven by two large scale long-term 
agreements signed in the fiscal year 2021/2022. The sales recognized from these two contracts contributed to the Alkaline-
Water Electrolysis (AWE). 
The majority of the remaining performance obligation is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 to 36 months 
following the respective balance sheet date. This estimate is based on our best judgment, as it needs to consider estimates of 
possible future contract modifications.

bodies. Such expenses to be compensated by the Company include expenses in connection with the defined benefit plans 
granted to the Management Board of thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG and will, at a minimum, include current service 
cost relating to services performed after the legal transfer of the defined benefit plan which will be charged to the Company on 
a regular basis, but could also include additional payments required to be made by the Company to cover potential plan deficits 
arising at the level of thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG in the future. As such, thyssenkrupp nucera AG & Co. KGaA is not 
released from all risks associated with the defined benefit plans subsequent to the legal transfer effective June 1, 2022 and 
therefore, continues to recognize the accrued pension liability for members of the Management Board of thyssenkrupp nucera 
Management AG. The cash payment to thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG made in connection with the legal transfer of the 
defined benefit plans as well as future compensation payments regarding current service costs are accounted for as a 
reimbursement right. As such it is recognized at fair value to the extent such reimbursement right does not exceed the accrued 
pension liability (ceiling of reimbursement right) and presented as other non-financial (non-current) asset (cf. Note 10).  
benefits. The benefit amount is 
defined as total accrued points at retirement / resignation / death multiplied by a factor linked to service and a factor linked to 
involuntary or voluntary vesting requirements. The multiple varies depending on the reason for exit, so that the amount received 
for voluntary resignation is lower (for any service period) than if reaching the mandatory retirement age. The plan in Japan 
includes a Corporate Pension Plan and a Retirement Allowance Plan. The Corporate Pension Plan is governed by the Ministry 
of Health, Labour and Welfare in accordance with the Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Law in Japan. The plan is subject to 
minimum funding requirements stipulated in law, which requires the company in Japan to pay additional contributions to 
achieve a minimum funding level within a certain time scale if the plan does not hold sufficient assets. The Japan company, as 
an employer, is responsible for the governance of the defined benefit plan. For further information regarding the composition 
of and investment strategy for funding assets, refer to the disclosures of the plan assets. 
Material risks associated with the different types of pension plans include all financial risks as well as risks in the areas of 
inflation and biometrics. 
As the plans are based on salary with annual pension modules directly linked to current salaries (e.g., contribution-oriented 
plans), inflation risks which could lead to an increase in benefit obligations of DB plans exist. Therefore, an increase in salaries 
above the trend assumptions used in the valuation of the obligation would also require a direct increase in future service cost. 
The pension plans in Germany paid as an annuity are required by law to provide a cost-of-living adjustment and may also be 
required under collective bargaining agreements or on a voluntary/discretionary basis. As such, further charges could result 
from a cost-of-living adjustment in excess of current pension trend assumptions during the pension payment phase, which 
would lead to an immediate increase in the provisions. 
Biometric risks can result either from early benefit claims (risk of sudden changes to the balance sheet after death or invalidity) 
or from underestimated life expectancies (longevity risk) and could likewise result in costs to the company due to unexpected 
increases in provisions and early cash outflows. 
Risks from changes to the discount rate are balance sheet-related and the provisions are adjusted directly against equity without 
affecting income or cash outflows. 
In Japan, employees leaving the company after more than 10 years are allowed to opt for receiving a 15-year annuity instead 
of lump sum payout posing an annuity selection rate risk to the company. Due to the conversion factors used for the annuity 
benefit determination, employees opting for annuity payment result in a higher liability for the company. If a higher percentage 
of employees opt for pension payment, the liability may increase considerably. 
Under the pension plans in Germany, individual beneficiaries are considered more than once in the employee count due to 
entitlements under different components of the pension systems. The breakdown of total of pension plans is as follows:

The assumptions for discount rates, rates of compensation increase, and the rate of pension progression on which the 
calculation of the obligations is based were derived in accordance with standard principles and established for each country 
based on their respective economic conditions. Discount rates are generally determined based on market yields of AA-rated 
corporate bonds of appropriate term and currency.  
The rate of compensation increase for plans in Japan varies depending on age. The rate varied from 2.3% as of 
September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: 2.3%, September 30, 2020: 2.3%) to 11.1% (September 30, 2021: 11.1%, 
September 30, 2020: 11.0%). 
The increase (decrease) in rate of pension progression in Germany is due to the increased (decreased) inflation expectations 
for Germany. In Japan, the pension plan is provided as a lump sum and the option to choose an annuity instead of lump sum 
exists if 10 or more years of service have been provided. Additionally, in Japan, a fixed 15 year annuity is available starting 
from age 60. 20% of plan participants selected the option across all reporting dates.

to group-specific circumstances. In Japan, MHLW Standard were used in determination for the demographic assumptions.  
Alternative assumptions would result in the following changes in the defined benefit obligation and the corresponding reverse 
changes in equity.  
The table shows the effects of the change in one assumption with all other assumptions remaining unchanged for plans in

To test the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a change in the mortality and life expectancy assumptions, an 
alternative analysis was carried out using of 10% lower mortality probabilities from retirement age. For beneficiaries currently 
aged 63 to 65, this roughly corresponds to a one-year increase in life expectancy on entering retirement. 
A change in the discount rate for the plan in Japan would result in following increases in the defined benefit obligation and the 
corresponding decrease in equity. The table below shows effect from change in discount rate while all other assumptions 
remaining unchanged. Changes of other assumptions do not have any material impact on the defined benefit obligation.

The Group invests in diversified portfolios consisting of an array of asset classes that attempt to maximize returns while 
minimizing volatility. The major part of 
reported plan assets associated with the funded pension plans are located 
in Japan. The asset classes in Japan mainly include investments in insurance contracts and pension trust fund. Plan assets do 
 
The Group uses professional investment managers to invest plan assets based on specific investment guidelines. The 
Investment Committees of the respective plan consist of senior financial management especially from treasury and other 
appropriate executives. The Investment Committees meet regularly to review the risks and performance of the major assets 
and approve the selection and retention of external managers. 
For the G
 main pension assets, asset liability studies are also regularly carried out, as part of which actuaries conduct a 
detailed analysis of the structure of the pension obligations (specifically focusing on age structure, duration, possible interest 
rate/inflation risks etc.). The investment strategy and target portfolio of the pension assets are then defined and updated as a 
result of these studies. For risk management purposes, liability-driven investment strategies may be used through which assets 
are geared towards the pension liabilities.  
The processes established for managing and monitoring the plan assets as described above are used to counteract the 
common risks associated with capital market investment - counterparty, liquidity/market and other risks. 
As of the balance sheet dates, the portfolio of these major plan assets comprises the following asset categories:

The carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, other current receivables as well as cash, cash 
equivalents equal their fair values due to the short remaining terms. 
The fair value of foreign currency forward transactions is determined on the basis of the middle spot exchange rate applicable 
as of the balance sheet date, adjusted for any forward premiums or discounts arising for the remaining contract term compared 
to the contracted forward exchange rate. 
The carrying amounts of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities are equal their fair values as they are considered 
short-term in nature.  
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be categorized in the following three-level fair value hierarchy:

The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial instruments with a fair 
value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in level 1. In level 2, determination of fair values is 
based on observable inputs, e.g., foreign exchange rates. Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments for which a fair value 
measurement is based on unobservable inputs using recognized valuation models. 
In the reporting year there were no reclassifications between level 1 and level 2. 
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an impairment loss is recognized for expected losses. 
The impairment losses on trade accounts receivable recognized at amortized cost and contract assets are as follows:

Individual allowances amounting to 0 thousand as of September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021:

inability to pay.  
ratings for each counterparty, which allows more accurate calculation of the probability of default compared with the formation 
of rating classes. The customer risk numbers assigned by trade credit insurers and the creditworthiness information provided 
by credit agencies are translated into an individual probability of default per customer using a central allocation system. This 
individual probability of default per customer is used uniformly throughout the thyssenkrupp nucera Group. The information is 
updated quarterly. If no rating information is available at counterparty level, an assessment is made based on the average 
probability of default for each segment plus an appropriate risk premium. For the Group financial statements as of 
September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the latest external credit information and ratings were used, which already take into 
account current expectations of the possible effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the model takes forward-looking 
information derived from current macroeconomic conditions into account (e.g., increase in material and personnel costs in the 
short-term; a degressive increase in material and personnel costs in the mid-term). According to this valuation model, no 
additional adjustment of impairment is necessary. Overall, this model shows a moderate but not significant increase in the 
valuation of individual customers.  
The gross carrying amounts, impairment losses and average probabilities of default for each segment are shown below.

default, as shown in the tables above, is primarily driven by the risk profile of customers in the regions the respective segments 
are operating in (cf. Note 21), i.e., customer specific country risk premiums are reflected therein. To minimize default risk for 
trade accounts receivable and contract assets the Group concludes transactions only with counterparties who have a good 
credit rating or are members of a deposit protection fund. For long-term contracts, additional security is provided in the form 
of advance payments received. The creditworthiness of the business partners with which projects are made is continuously 
monitored by tracking their credit ratings (cf. Credit Risk section). The Group therefore considers the default risk to be low 
The maximum credit risk exposure of the financial assets subject to the impairment models corresponds to the gross carrying 
amounts less the recognized impairment losses. 
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts. Derivative financial instruments are generally used to hedge existing or 
anticipated underlying transactions so as to reduce foreign currency risks. In rare cases, the derivatives are designated in the 
Japan segment as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes to hedge future cash flows against foreign currency 
risks arising from future sales and purchase transactions. 
The following table shows the notional amounts and fair values of derivatives used within the Group:

In rare cases cash flow hedges are used in the Japan segment to hedge future cash flows against foreign currency risks arising 
from future sales and purchase transactions. In the case of cash flow hedges, the earnings effect of the hedging instruments 
is generally also shown in the same profit and loss item as the hedged underlying transaction. The Group did not maintain 
significant derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges during the reporting periods.  
The Group mainly uses derivative financial instruments in order to economically hedge against exchange rate risks in the 
German and China segment. If a hedging relationship does not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance 
with the conditions under IFRS 9 or hedge accounting is economically not reasonable, the derivative financial instrument is 
recognized as a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting. The resulting impact on profit and loss from derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized either in other income or other expenses (cf. Note 
24 and 25). 
During the course of ordinary activities, the thyssenkrupp nucera Group is exposed to financial risks in the form of credit risks 
(default risk), liquidity risks and market risks (foreign currency risks). The aim of risk management is to limit the risks arising 
from operating activities and associated financing requirements by applying selected derivative hedging instruments. Within 
the framework of risk management, financial risks and credit risks must be avoided as far as possible, compensated by a risk 
portfolio, passed on to third parties or limited (principle of risk aversion). 
Credit risk (default risk) is the risk of the Group incurring financial losses due to the non-fulfilment or partial fulfilment of existing 
debt obligations. Credit risk management is governed by corporate guidelines. Segments and group companies are required 
to implement credit risk management in accordance with these guidelines. 
In order to minimize default risks (credit risks) from the use of financial instruments, such transactions are only concluded with 
counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements. Credit risk management defines minimum requirements for the 
selection of counterparties so that financial instruments in the financing area are only entered into with counterparties who have 
a good credit rating or are members of a deposit protection fund. Creditworthiness is monitored on the basis of assessments 
by recognized rating agencies and also taking into account short-term early warning indicators. Continuous and standardized 
monitoring of ratings and early warning indicators enables us to minimize risks at an early stage. Derivative financial instruments 
are generally entered into on the basis of standard contracts in which it is possible to net open transactions with the respective 
business partners. 
Default risks are generally hedged with suitable instruments. These include private and state credit insurance as well as letters 
of credit and guarantees from banks, insurance companies and management companies. For long-term contracts, additional 
security is provided in the form of advance payments received. In order to further minimize default risks from operating 
activities, the corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default risk based on the risk profile of the business partner 
using suitable internal and, where available, external information, such as ratings and credit reports. Credit limits are set for 
each business partner using this credit rating. The assessment of the risk profile for each business partner is subject to 
appropriate, ongoing monitoring, which enables the Group to minimize risk at an early stage. Based on the individual 
characteristics of the operating segments customers there are processes and guidelines for determining which measures are 
to be taken in the event of a deterioration creditworthiness or payment default to mitigate the maximum default risk. 
Transactions whose value exceeds specified materiality thresholds, especially when the business is undergoing major projects, 
also require prior approval at thyssenkrupp nucera Group level. Additionally, the amount and hedging of default risks is 
assessed.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its existing or future obligations due to insufficient availability of cash 
or cash equivalents. Liquidity risk was managed by the Group by means of integration into the cash pooling and cash 
management systems of tk Group.

Cash flows from derivatives are offset by cash flows from hedged underlying transactions, which have not been considered in 
the analysis of maturities. If cash flows from the hedged underlying transactions were considered, the cash flows shown in the 
table would decrease. 
Market risk is the risk that fair values or future cash flows of non-derivative or derivative financial instruments will fluctuate due 
to changes in risk factors. Among market risks relevant to the Group are foreign currency, procurement (commodity price), and 
especially raw material price risks. Associated with these risks are fluctuations in income, equity and cash flow.  
The results and figures identified through sensitivity analyses represent hypothetical, future-oriented data that can differ from 
actual outcomes because of unforeseeable developments in financial markets. Non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as 
business risks, are not considered.

Foreign currency hedging is used to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates as protection against any unfavourable exchange 
rate fluctuations in the future. Hedging periods are generally based on the maturities of underlying transactions. Foreign 
currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of twelve months or less but can also be up to six years in single 
exceptional cases.  
The US dollar is the only relevant risk variable for sensitivity analyses under IFRS 7, as the vast majority of foreign currency 
cash flows occurs in US dollars. As hedging transactions are generally used to hedge underlying transactions, opposite effects 
in underlying and hedging transactions are almost entirely offset over the total period. Therefore, the currency risk exposure 
described results from hedging relationships with off-balance sheet underlying transactions, i.e., hedges of firm commitments 
and forecasted sales. Based on our analysis, the exposure to the US dollar as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as 
follows: 
If the euro had been 10% stronger against the US dollar as of September 30, 2022, the earnings resulting from the 
measurement as of the balance sheet date would have been 1,265 thousand lower (September 30, 2021
591 thousand 
higher, September 30, 
). 
If the euro had been 10% weaker against the US dollar as of September 30, 2022, the earnings resulting from the measurement 
as of the balance sheet date would have been 1,418 thousand higher (September 30, 2021
660 thousand lower, September 
 thousand lower). 
The Group is only exposed to a minor interest rate risk resulting from the cash pooling financed at 
. 
These Consolidated Financial Statements include transactions between the Group and tk Group (tk AG and its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries, excluding the Group) and with IDN. tk Group is a related party, as tk AG controls the Group (cf. Note 1.1). IDN has 
a significant influence over the Group. 
On August 4, 2022 tk Group, IDN and the Group signed a relationship agreement in which the parties desire, and see it in 
their best interest, to lay down in this agreement certain general principles for their future relationship, the areas they wish to 
co-operate in for the benefit of the Parties and the tk Group as a whole.  
Based on a general service agreement tk IS AG provides the Group with general and administrative services such as tax, legal, 
controlling, accounting, IT or insurance 
. The general service agreement also covers operational functions 
such as construction management, engineering, project management, quality management and R&D.  
In conjunction with the IPO, the terms of the general service agreement between tk Group and the Group have been re-
negotiated. Beginning from October 1, 2021 additional services historically not covered by the general service agreement, 
especially governance functions like internal audit services, tax statement preparation and handling as well as compliance 
services are provided to the Group. As such, costs historically charged to the Group differ from the costs that have been charged 
to the Group beginning from October 1, 2021 based on the re-negotiated terms. Therefore, the costs for service contracts for 
the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022 are not comparable to prior periods, since additional services have been 
agreed. The new service agreements have a term of 12 months with a one-time, unilateral right of renewal for 12 months, in 
some cases, a two-time, unilateral right of renewal for 12 months. As of the balance sheet date the Group was in the process 
to prolong its service level agreements with tk Group (cf. Note 31 subsequent events).  
In addition, supply and delivery agreements exist between the Group and tk Group. The Group is supplied by the tk Group and 
delivers to tk Group goods and services on a case-by-case basis.

During the reporting periods, the Group was integrated into the cash pooling and cash management systems of tk Group. Cash 
pooling is largely centralized at tk AG and certain financing companies (i.e., Cashpool leaders). Relevant Cashpool leaders for 
thyssenkrupp nucera Group Entities are located in Germany (EUR), USA (USD) and China (CNY). The Group typically has excess 
also made to Note 9. Basis for the cash pooling system is the tk Group Operating Instruction Financing and the cash 
management agreement. The cash management agreement was concluded for an indefinite period of time. Group companies 
with bank accounts connected to an automatic cash pool system are required to communicate their financial requirements or 
surplus funds to the cash pool leader in order to ensure effective cash management. Financial receivables and liabilities 
from/due tk Group are presented without netting in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cashpool balances are interest-
bearing. Both, borrowings and deposits are subject to interest at a pre-defined base interest rate that is oriented on the money 
market (EURIBOR for Euro or LIBOR for foreign currencies, floored at 0%). In case of borrowings, a refinancing cost levy is 
charged on top of the base interest rate. This refinancing cost levy is based on the funding costs of tk AG and is determined on 
a quarterly basis. Interest income received from cashpool receivables are provided in Note 26.

The Group currently has the following management incentive plans, comprising plans implemented at the Company level and, 
exclusively with respect to member of the Management Board at thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG level.  
The long-term incentive plan (LTI) is a long-term oriented compensation component under which stock rights of the ultimate 
parent of the Company (i.e., tk AG) were issued to eligible participants until fiscal year 2019/2020. Plan participants are 
Management Board members and several other selected executive employees of the Group. As of September 30, 2022, no 
stock rights were issued of the LTI (September 30, 2021: 13,437 stock rights; September 30, 2020: 19,184 stock rights).  
The number of stock rights issued will be adjusted at the end of the respective three-year tk AG Value Added (tkVA) performance 
period based on the average tkVA over the period compared to a tkVA target value set in advance. The amount of payment for 
an instalment is calculated by multiplying the adjusted number of stock rights by the average price of t
 stock in the first 
three months after the end of the tkVA performance period, with the result that the term of each instalment extends over four 
fiscal years in total. 
The LTI is exclusively settled in cash after the end of the respective performance period. The fair value of these rights is 
calculated on the date of grant and on each balance sheet date and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period with a corresponding increase in provisions for other non-current employee benefits. The provision is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the provision are recognized 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
To determine the fair value of the stock rights used to calculate the pro-rata liability as of the balance sheet date forward prices 
of the tk AG stock are calculated in consideration of existing caps. The forward calculation is carried out for predefined periods 
(averaging periods) using the tk AG stock price and the euro interest rate curve as of the balance sheet date and the dividends 
assumed to be paid until the stock rights reach maturity.

Effective March 2022 thyssenkrupp nucera Management AG has contractually committed to grant a New LTI instalment for 
fiscal year 2021/2022 that will be issued after the IPO. The new LTI instalment amounts to a 7/12 share of the amount that 
would have been granted if the New LTI had been issued effective October 1, 2021. The New LTI has a performance period of 
four years and is granted in annual installments. At the beginning of each installment, a certain number of virtual shares is 
allocated on a provisional basis to each board member. This number is calculated by dividing the annual gross target amount 
of 
trading days before the start of the fiscal year for which the respective new LTI installment is issued. The final number of virtual 
shares at the end of the four-year performance period depends on the target achievement with regard to the relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company compared to the Solactive Hydrogen Economy Index NTR. The final number of virtual 
shares is subsequently converted into the final payout amount using the share price at the end of the performance period,
