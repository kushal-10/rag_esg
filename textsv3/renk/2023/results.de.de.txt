Letter from the Management Board

Liebe Leserinnen und Leser,  
 
Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 hat RENK seinen 150. Geburtstag gefeiert – eine bewegte Erfolgsgeschichte, auf die wir stolz 
sind. Im Jahre 1873 von Johann Julius Renk gegründet, hat sich RENK von einer kleinen Werkstatt zur automatisierten 
Herstellung von Zahnrädern zu einem globalen Technologieführer und Partner für sichere, innovative und nachhaltige 
Mobilitäts- und Antriebslösungen mit 19 Produktions- und Servicestandorten in Europa, Amerika und Asien entwickelt. 
Unser Markenkern basiert auf Entwicklungs-, Produktions- und Testexpertise über den gesamten Produktlebenszyklus 
hinweg. Dies versetzt uns in die Lage, durch Wartungs- und sonstige Dienstleistungen missionskritische und höchst 
anspruchsvolle Anwendungsprofile dauerhaft zu übertreffen. Wir produzieren Sicherheit: Als systemrelevanter Partner 
für militärische Mobilitätslösungen hilft RENK, die Grundlage für eine friedliche Gesellschaft und wirtschaftlichen 
Wohlstand zu sichern. 
Dieses Leistungsprofil ist heute relevanter als je zuvor. Das Jahr 2023 war von einer Fortsetzung des Krieges in der 
Ukraine und dem terroristischen Angriff auf Israel geprägt. Darüber hinaus ist die Ablösung der Nachkriegsordnung hin 
zu multipolaren Machtzentren ein Szenario, welches neue Anforderungen an bestehende Sicherheitsarchitekturen stellt. 
Dies erfordert eine glaubhafte Befähigung zur Verteidigung, auch und insbesondere in Fällen einer konventionellen 
Konfliktführung. Des Weiteren sind wir der festen Überzeugung, dass unsere Antriebstechnologien einen Beitrag zur 
Mobilität leisten, die für den Erhalt einer globalisierten Welt- und Friedensordnung unerlässlich ist, welche über 
Jahrzehnte Garant für Wohlstand und Freiheit war. Gleiches gilt für die soziale und ökologische Nachhaltigkeit, die das 
notwendige Fundament jenseits kurzfristiger Planungshorizonte bildet und die eigene Zukunftsfähigkeit mitbestimmt. 
Unsere Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie 2025 ist auf das Ziel ausgerichtet, bis 2040 global klimaneutral zu werden. Darüber 
hinaus leisten wir mit unseren Produkten einen Beitrag zu Energie- und Emissionseinsparungen bei unseren Kunden. 
Das angespannte geopolitische Umfeld findet seinen Widerhall in einem beispiellosen Anstieg der Leitzinssätze, welcher 
binnen kürzester Frist ein Jahrzehnt des billigen Geldes beendet hat. Staatliche und unternehmerische Ausgaben 
müssen sich wieder zunehmend daran messen lassen, ob sie geforderte Renditen erwirtschaften. Aufgrund unserer 
stringenten Ausrichtung auf Technologieführerschaft, Exzellenz und Effektivität sehen wir uns hierfür unverändert gut 
gerüstet. Mit einem Auftragseingang von 1,277 Mio. € (+29 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr) und einen Umsatz von 
926 Mio. € (+9 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr) konnte RENK im Geschäftsjahr 2023 an den Wachstumspfad der 
vorangegangenen Jahre anknüpfen.  
Während des Geschäftsjahres wurden die Voraussetzungen geschaffen, RENK zurück an den Kapitalmarkt zu bringen. 
Aufgrund eines eingetrübten Marktumfelds wurde jedoch zunächst der Entschluss gefasst, den für Oktober 2023 
vorbereiteten Börsengang nicht durchzuführen, diese Option aber für den Fall einer positiven Entwicklung des 
Marktumfelds offenzuhalten. Im Januar 2024 konnte RENK hiervon Gebrauch machen und neue Investoren gewinnen, 
die unsere Unternehmensentwicklung auch in Zukunft proaktiv begleiten. 
 
Wir wünschen Ihnen eine informative Lektüre!

Greetings from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Liebe Aktionärinnen und Aktionäre, 
 
das abgeschlossene Geschäftsjahr war für RENK erneut ein erfolgreiches und von Wachstum geprägtes Jahr. Das  
150-jährige Jubiläum setzte einen Meilenstein in der Unternehmensgeschichte und wir sind davon überzeugt, dass 
RENK die besten Voraussetzungen hat, um diese Geschichte erfolgreich weiterzuschreiben.  
Nach der Abspaltung von Volkswagen hat RENK eine rapide Transformation vollzogen und sich in nicht einmal drei 
Jahren zu einem weltweit führenden Anbieter von einsatzkritischen Antriebstechnologien für den Verteidigungs-, 
Industrie- und Energiesektor mit einer starken Präsenz in Schlüsselmärkten entwickelt. Besonders hervorzuheben sind 
die Akquisitionen, die unter anderem die geografische Expansion nach Nordamerika vorangetrieben haben. 
Dank des unermüdlichen Einsatzes der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter und des Vorstands ist es uns gemeinsam 
gelungen, alle Segmente von RENK auch im vergangenen Jahr weiter zu stärken. 
Trotz des komplexen globalen Wirtschaftsumfelds hat RENK Widerstandsfähigkeit und eine rasche Anpassungsfähigkeit 
bewiesen, was nicht zuletzt die Robustheit des Geschäftsmodells, die eingeschlagene Wachstumsstrategie und die 
Position von RENK als herausragenden Anbieter auf dem Markt militärischer und ziviler Antriebstechnologien 
unterstreicht. Die geopolitische Lage unterstreicht zudem die Relevanz der RENK Group und ihres Leistungsspektrums. 
Der Aufsichtsrat war aktiv an der Überwachung der Unternehmensführung und strategischen Ausrichtung von RENK 
beteiligt. Die Entsprechung mit Gesetz, Satzung und sonstigen Compliance-Anforderungen ist eine notwendige 
Bedingung für das unternehmerische Handeln in einem hochregulierten Umfeld. Uns als Aufsichtsrat fiel daher eine 
entscheidende Rolle zu, die Aktivitäten des Vorstands zu überwachen, diesen aber gleichzeitig bei der 
Aufrechterhaltung und Durchsetzung eines angemessenen internen Kontrollsystems zu unterstützen.  
Nach der Aufhellung des Marktumfelds konnte RENK am 07. Februar 2024 im zweiten Anlauf seine Rückkehr an die 
Börse feiern. Dies spiegelt nicht nur das Vertrauen der Investoren in das Unternehmen wider, sondern wird RENK auch 
auf seinem Wachstumskurs unterstützen. 
Den Kunden von RENK
 
stellen sich neue Herausforderungen, auf die das Unternehmen hervorragende Antworten hat. Wir sehen RENK daher 
mit besten Zukunftsperspektiven gerüstet für eine erfolgreiche wirtschaftliche Entwicklung. Grundlage hierfür ist das 
Engagement für technologische Innovation, kombiniert mit einer herausgehobenen Marktposition und begleitet durch 
Investoren, die den Wachstumspfad der Gesellschaft nachhaltig unterstützen.  
 
Mit besten Grüßen, 
 
Claus von Hermann 
Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrats, RENK Group AG

1. Description of business 
1.1 
Organizational and reporting structure 
The RENK Group (after also referred to as RENK) comprises RENK Group AG and its subsidiaries. RENK Group AG, 
domiciled in Augsburg (Germany), is registered with the local court of Augsburg under the Commercial Register number 
HRB 39189. The company was converted into a stock corporation with effect from September 13, 2023. The company 
acts as a holding company in the RENK Group. After the Initial Public Offering originally planned for October 2023 was 
postponed, the company went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on February 7, 2024.  
As the ultimate parent company, RENK Group AG indirectly holds all shares in the operating RENK companies headed 
by RENK GmbH, Augsburg, through the intermediary RENK FinCo GmbH, Augsburg.  
In line with the German Stock Corporation Act (“Aktiengesetz”), the RENK Group AG Executive Board is the governing 
body with overall responsibility for managing the Company’s business. The Supervisory Board of the company is 
responsible for monitoring the business development and the Executive Board.  
RENK considers itself one of the primary providers of drive technology for a wide range of applications with a global 
focus. Production sites are located in Germany, the United States of America (“US”), France, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, and India.  
RENK’s business activities in fiscal year 2023 were divided into three segments: Vehicle Mobility Solutions (VMS), 
Marine & Industry (M&I), and Slide Bearings (SB).  
13,4 % of our staff were female reporting period. Women accounted for 11.9 % of senior management positions and  
25 % of the Supervisory Board. 50 % of the current Executive Board is female. To increase the percentage of women at 
senior management levels below the Executive Board, RENK set a target of 16 % for fiscal year 2025 and 20 % for 
2030. For this, we consider internal female young talents in succession planning. At least one equally qualified woman 
should also be included in the final selection pool for all management vacancies. To increase the number of applications 
received from women, special efforts are made to target, recruit, and further develop this group by taking a gender-
neutral approach and through strategic career development. 
As well as gender diversity, RENK also strives to be aware of and increase the share of senior managers of foreign 
origin. To ensure success in this regard, the entire application process follows a global approach. Job advertisements 
are written in English for all sites and published on international platforms. Increasingly, personnel advisers who operate 
worldwide are contracted to find top candidates. 
1.2 
Business model 
RENK's aim is to maintain and expand its leading technological position in RENK's key sectors in the future and to 
generate profitable growth. Key pillars of this strategy include further internationalization, a long-term focus on customer 
needs, operating excellence in all fields and constant innovation.  
The RENK group is divided into three segments. These are based on a product or market/customer structure and have a 
segment manager with full operating responsibility who reports directly to the RENK Group AG Executive Board. The 
Executive Board of RENK Group AG was the chief operating decision maker in fiscal year 2023 and is identical to the 
management of RENK GmbH.

Marine & Industry (M&I)  
Our M&I segment is a technology leader for gear units and coupling & clutches solutions for naval forces, commercial 
shipping, and industrial applications. In shipping, our products are primarily used in naval surface combatants such as 
frigates and corvettes for naval customers and in high-speed ferries, freighters, and super-yachts for civilian customers. 
Our marine gear units for naval vessels are used by more than 40 naval forces around the world. In the industrial sector, 
our customers include plastics, steel, and cement production companies, as well as companies working in oil and gas, 
hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), industrial heat pump applications, and the energy generation 
industry. Our M&I segment serves markets throughout the world, including Germany, Europe, the United States of 
America, South America, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region. Our global network of sales and service centers 
enables us to provide rapid, on-the-ground support to customers worldwide. Thanks to our tailored solutions, we can 
offer customers products that meet their specific needs.   
Slide Bearings (SB)  
Our SB segment is the global market leader for standardized slide bearings (e-bearings) for electric machinery and 
hydrodynamic lubricated standard slide bearings. We provide slide bearings for various industrial electric drive systems, 
as well as for energy generation (both conventional energy generation and hydropower, wind power, and nuclear energy 
generation), other industrial applications, and for military and civilian ships. Our slide bearings are used in applications

products such as complex special slide bearings. We have assembly, maintenance, repair, and operating centers in 
multiple regions around the world, as well as a global network of representatives and partners.  
1.3 
Research and development (R&D) 
Our self-financed research and development (R&D) expenses in fiscal year 2023 came to € 21.9 million (2022: 
€ 18.3 million). The resulting R&D ratio (R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue) was 2.4 % (2022: 2.2 %). As of 
December 31, 2023, RENK held around 425 individual patents and utility models in its continuing operations (2022: 
around 437). RENK also has about 68 (2022: 68) registered trademarks.  
Research and development activities are essential for the RENK Group to maintain and expand its leading technological 
position. We work closely with various universities, research institutions, and industry partners to remain at the cutting 
edge of technology and continually improve our products.   
Continually investing in R&D is crucial to providing innovative solutions for our customers. In particular, our R&D 
activities focus on technological trends and the requirements of our customers in relation to unmanned vehicles and 
vessels.  
In relation to hybridization, we are investing in developing innovative electric and hybrid drive systems for military 
vehicles and ships. Our solutions aim to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

To meet rising demand for digital solutions for the use of product and maintenance data to improve engineering and 
manufacturing processes, we have developed digital solutions that make it easy for shipping and industrial customers to 
access technical documents, spare parts, and service information.   
We have also implemented Industry 4.0 solutions, such as machine data recording systems and big data analytics, to 
optimize processes and increase efficiency. Providing digital data requires sensors to collect and collate this data. We 
are working on intelligent sensors so that the data can be analysed and interpreted using artificial intelligence (AI).  
To support the transition to green energy, we are also developing green energy components and systems.   
    
2. Financial performance system 
2.1 
Financial framework 
RENK's planning and management is based on a multi-stage process. Medium-term planning, which is prepared once 
per year and covers a three-year period, is the basis for managing the RENK Group and forms the core of operational 
planning. Based on this, we prepare product and program/project planning for each segment, which is subsequently 
incorporated in the financial medium-term planning. This comprises capital expenditure needed for decision alternatives 
related to future products and operational options, as well as earnings and financial planning.  
The first planning year in medium-term planning is monthly and represents RENK’s budget. Budget attainment 
throughout the year is monitored on an ongoing basis and is used as the basis for operational management. 
Budget/actual comparisons, prior-year comparisons, variance analyses and, where necessary and feasible, action plans 
to ensure budget targets are met are used here. Revolving forecasts are prepared for the current fiscal year. These take 
account of current risks and opportunities. The focus of internal management during the year is therefore on adapting to 
internal and external facts and circumstances in order to achieve targets. 
RENK’s financial performance system is based on performance indicators (PIs). The most important performance 
indicators (key performance indicators, KPIs) are projected for the following fiscal year and target attainment analysed in 
comparison to previous projections. The RENK Group also sets medium-term targets to be achieved during the medium-
term planning period. See section 7 Report on expected developments for the KPI forecast. 
Growth, profitability, and liquidity are the main factors in RENK’s strategic vision and are implemented through 
performance indicators. In some cases, these are used as parameters for variable management remuneration. 
Some performance indicators are referred to as alternative performance measures (APMs). These are not defined under 
IFRS and so are not an original component of IFRS financial statements. APMs are used and reported because RENK 
believes that they provide stakeholders with additional information that is relevant to their decision making. Due to their 
company-specific nature, they may not be comparable with APMs of other companies. 
In prior periods and in addition to the performance indicators described below, RENK classified the cash flow from 
operating activities (operating cash flow), operating profit and the operating margin as KPIs. As a result of its focus 
towards the capital market, the internal reporting system was realigned in the 2023 financial year and adapted to the 
financial framework presented below. 
2.2 
Growth 
Growth at the RENK Group is measured, managed, and monitored by revenue (KPI), order backlog (PI/APM), and order 
intake (PI/APM). Order intake represents the addition of binding customer contracts within the reporting period, 
measured by the transaction price on which customer contracts are to be based in accordance with IFRS 15 accounting 
regulations. This PI is used as a parameter for variable management remuneration.

A. Combined Management Report

The fixed order backlog at the end of the fiscal year comprises the order backlog for the previous year plus the current 
order intake and less revenue generated in the current fiscal year. Since fiscal year 2023, RENK’s total order backlog 
has included orders from binding customer contracts as well as orders agreed with customers under master agreements 
but not yet substantiated by customer orders or call-off orders (frame order backlog) and prospective order backlogs 
(soft order backlog), which are based on past experience, customer dependencies due to product specificity, and 
publicly available information. This implied forecast covers the term of master agreements and, for prospective order 
backlogs without a binding contractual basis, a period not exceeding four fiscal years after the end of the reporting 
period. 
2.3 
Profitability 
The adjusted EBIT margin (KPI/APM) is the primary measure of RENK’s profitability. The calculation is based on net 
profit for the year before the financial result and taxes (EBIT) (PI/APM) adjusted for non-recurring effects, relative to 
revenue. Eliminations of the financial result and income taxes are used to neutralize various financing activities and 
inconsistent taxation systems between countries, in turn facilitating inter-company comparisons. By adjusting for non-
recurring effects, RENK aims to focus information on operating activities. Reported EBIT (operating profit/loss) and the 
EBIT margin (operating return relative to revenue) were two of the key performance indicators in the previous year. 
Adjustments in the fiscal year, summarized in the table RENK adjustments, comprise the effects of M&A activities 
including purchase price allocations, costs for preparing the company’s IPO, inflation compensation premiums paid, 
severance expenses, and other effects that do not provide any information on operating activities performance. 
RENK provides information on future distribution potential through adjusted net income (PI/APM). The profit or loss 
reported for the fiscal year is adjusted for non-recurring effects in line with the calculation of the adjusted EBIT margin, 
but in this case less the income tax effect on total adjusted non-recurring effects. The Group tax rate is used to 
determine the tax effect. Profit/loss after tax (PI) and the related basic earnings per share (PI) presented in the 
consolidated financial statements are central performance indicators for the RENK Group that impact the company’s 
attractiveness on the capital market. By referencing such performance indicators that include earnings effects which are 
not covered by operational managing and monitoring activities, we highlight the need for management to also focus on 
non-recurring effects. Profit/loss after tax is also a parameter for variable management remuneration. 
RENK also intends to establish ROCE (return on capital employed) (from 2025 onwards: KPI/APM) as an indicator of the 
Group’s return on investment. Adjusted EBIT is calculated in relation to the average capital employed for the fiscal year. 
The latter comprises average property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the start and end of the fiscal year, 
as well as average net working capital (NWC) (see section 7.6.3 Liquidity). 
2.4 
Liquidity 
The RENK Group’s liquidity is determined by the ability to generate a positive net cash inflow. In consequence, we use 
free cash flow (PI/APM) to address this focus. Depreciation and amortization, interest paid, income taxes, and capital 
expenditures are added to EBIT for calculation purposes. Free cash is reduced by an increase in NWC (PI/APM) and 
increased by its decline. Other reconciliation items include changes to provisions, provided these are not attributable to 
NWC, and other cash and non-cash effects with minor individual relevance. 
Capital efficiency and thus NWC management are central to RENK. NWC is the sum of trade receivables, contract 
assets, and inventories less the sum of trade payables, contract liabilities, and liabilities from customer prepayments not 
allocated to contract liabilities. For management purposes, we compare the nominal value of NWC to revenue for the 
fiscal year (PI/APM).  
Managing long-term capital employed is key to ensuring an efficient overall capital base. RENK focuses on capital 
expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which also effect net cash inflow. For management 
purposes, we also compare investment payments to revenue in the fiscal year (PI/APM) to highlight the intrinsic 
relationship between value creation and the required productive capital base. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
20 
 
For liquidity management purposes, RENK currently also focuses on the Group’s net debt (PI/APM). As a measure of 
debt sustainability, we compare net debt to adjusted EBIT plus depreciation of property, plant and equipment and 
amortization of intangible assets (PI/APM). Net debt is defined as the sum of bond and lease liabilities less cash and 
cash equivalents. 
2.5 
Other performance indicators 
RENK is committed to providing sustainable solutions in its segments that make mobility solutions more energy efficient. 
At the same time, our business activities are based on social and environmental standards that RENK has formalized in 
its 2025 sustainability strategy and translated into key fields of action. The main focus is on establishing quantitative 
performance indicators and strengthening existing sustainability reporting to reflect the requirements of the Accounting 
Directive (Directive 2013/34/EU). The basis for this is a project plan that RENK aimed to develop during this fiscal year. 
Actual figures are also collected using external sustainability ratings. Establishing a project plan and carrying out a 
sustainability rating represent PIs and constitute central indicators for management remuneration in the current reporting 
period. The aim for the following year is to successfully implement the project plan. This includes compliance with 
relevant legal standards. 
    
3. Business performance in the fiscal year 
3.1 
Overall Executive Board assessment of current economic situation 
The Executive Board takes a predominantly positive view of business performance in fiscal year 2023. In contrast to 
global economic trends, RENK reported a significant order intake underpinned by all segments. Order processing was 
satisfactory and ensured that Group revenue was within forecast. Performance would have been even better if not for 
supply chain disruption, which negatively influenced production. Precautions were taken in the form of higher inventories 
to improve operating resilience. These two effects led to the ratio of NWC to revenue at 26.8 %, higher than the target 
value at 22 %. At the same time, higher inventory levels were key to increasing output and, in turn, leveraging 
economies of scale as well as efficiency improvements. The adjusted EBIT margin for the fiscal year therefore met the 
company’s own expectations. The operating profit and the operating margin, which were still part of the KPIs in the 
previous year, could not achieve the set objectives despite an extremely positive development. The main reasons for 
this are the additional burdens from the preparation for the capital market, costs for M&A activities, paid inflation 
compensation premiums, and severance payments.  
Acquiring General Kinetics expanded the Group’s position on the North American sales market, which is particularly 
important to RENK in view of its considerable defence budget, especially in the US. At 3.0 %, the ratio capital 
expenditure to revenue was in line with the upper limit set of 3 %. Net debt amounted to 2.4 as of the end of the 
reporting period and therefore did not decrease to below 2.0 as forecast. This is mainly due to the reduction of cash and 
cash equivalents in connection with repaying a shareholder loan. At the same time, supply chain disruptions, production 
stops, and capital being tied up in higher inventory levels prevented an adequate cash inflow. These were also key 
factors in the development of free cash flow, which was lower than in the previous year despite satisfactory earnings 
performance.

3.2 
Significant developments and events affecting business performance 
Besides general macroeconomic conditions, trends in military and civilian end markets are crucial to RENK. Economic 
performance in 2023 was shaped by a slowdown in global growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that 
global growth declined from 3.4 % in 2022 to 3.1 % in 2023. This level of growth is also assumed for 2024. The decline 
was particularly pronounced in developed economies. Growth contracted significantly from 2.6 % in 2022 to 1.6 % in 
2023 and is expected to bottom out in 2024 with a forecasted growth of 1.5 %. Growth in emerging markets, on the other 
hand, remained relatively stable and is predicated at 4.1 % from 2022 to 2024. Germany’s economic output was hit far 
harder than other EU member states and RENK’s global target markets. Price-adjusted gross domestic product was 
down 0.3 % year on year, while France, Spain, and Italy all reported growth (+0.8 %, +2.4 %, and +0.7 % respectively). 
Gross domestic product in the US rose sharply compared to the previous year in 2023, up 2.5 %, whereas growth in the 
United Kingdom fell to 0.5 %.  
As well as global uncertainties, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasingly fragmented economic areas 
and trade relations, and greater geopolitical stress factors, this economic slowdown reflects tighter monetary policy 
introduced in response to unprecedented inflation. Global inflation, which was 8.7 % in 2022, was predicted at 6.9 % for 
2023 and 5.8 % for 2024. The decline in inflation, which was significant to start with but then slowed, is indicative of 
persistent core inflation and so inflation targets will likely not be met until 2025. In line with global macroeconomic 
conditions, the German Machinery and Equipment Manufacturers Association (VDMA) anticipates zero revenue growth 
for international machinery revenue in 2023 and 2024. 
Contrary to these global economic trends, the defence market benefited from higher defence budgets, the result 
primarily of geopolitical developments and conflicts, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions 
such as those between China and Taiwan as well as the US respectively, and the conflict in the Middle East. At a global 
level, one key focus area is the defence budget in North America, which is expected to make up about 46 % of the 
international defence budget between 2018 and 2027. The global sales market for land and naval defence products 
(excluding embargoed countries) grew by an average of 11.6 % per year between 2018 and 2022 and will likely continue 
to expand by an average of 12.9 % between 2022 and 2027.

Thanks to growth trends in all segments, RENK reported order intake of € 1,276.5 million in the fiscal year (previous 
year: € 986.6 million). At € 196.6 million and a share in 62.5% of the order intake, the VMS segment and its drive 
solutions for tracked vehicles accounted for most of this significant year-on-year rise. Together, the M&I and SB 
segments reported an order intake of € 489.3 million (previous year: € 393.8 million). The considerable € 81.8 million 
increase to € 368.4 million in M&I was largely the result of new business in the marine sector. In SB, increased demand 
for horizontal bearings drove growth of 7.3 %, at the same time as in the previous year, the majority of the order intake 
is for e-bearings.

Group revenue amounted to € 925.5 million (previous year: € 849.0 million), thus showing a considerable increase.  
VMS was able to contribute to this with € 528.4 million and a sales increase of 8.8 %.As well as satisfactory organic 
growth, the acquisition of General Kinetics in January 2023 played a significant part in this development. At the end of 
the fiscal year, VMS accounted for 57.1 % of revenue. The new business of the segment was negatively affected by 
supply shortages on the procurement side. Revenue in the M&I segment also increased by a considerable 7.3 % to 
€ 296.3 million (previous year: € 276.1 million). The primary reasons for this were product completions and deliveries in 
industrial business as well as the services sector. The same nominal growth of € 20.0 million resulted in significant 
growth in SB of 22.0 % to total revenue of € 110.9 million (previous year: € 90.9 million). The high demand for horizontal 
and e-bearings as well as the spare parts and service business enabled this pleasing development. Consolidated 
intersegment revenue primarily relates to intragroup deliveries to the VMS segment.

RENK closed the fiscal year with a fixed order backlog of € 1,780.0 million (previous year: € 1,406.6 million), an 
extremely satisfactory increase of 26.6 %. The order backlog is allocated to VMS at 71.5 % (previous year: 70.2 %), M&I 
at 25.0 % (previous year: 26.1 %) and SB at 3.5 % (previous year: 3.7 %). Strong growth relates mainly to customers 
seeking military products. The medium-term frame order backlog based on master agreements and experience-driven 
customer behaviour totalled € 585.8 million at the end of the fiscal year. In addition, our assessments of current contract 
negotiations, our customers’ budgeting and decisions about government military spending put the estimated prospective 
soft order backlog at € 2,277.8 million for the medium-term planning horizon. Sales of military vehicles in VMS offer the 
most significant prospects of future customer orders.

RENK generated an EBIT of € 89.0 million (previous year: € 65.2 million) in the fiscal year. This significant growth 
resulted in an EBIT margin of 9.6 % (previous year: 7.7 %). In addition to the positive revenue development, scale 
effects due to overall increased output quantities, the systematical implementation of efficiency programs and lower 
PPA-related effects contributed to this development. These positive success factors were able to overcompensate for 
the weaker performance of VMS due to supply chain disruptions. The Group realized an increase in gross profit to 
€ 208.7 million (previous year: € 164.8 million), thus recording a substantial increase of 26.6 % compared to previous 
year. The distribution expenses related to the sales growth developed in a profit-reducing manner, with a considerable of 
7.5 % to € 51.7 Mio. € (previous year: € 48.1 Mio. €). General and administrative expenses also rose significantly to  
€ 66.0 Mio. € (previous year: € 49.8 Mio. €). Factors contributing to this development included higher costs for corporate 
functions, expenses for the implementation of efficiency programs, in particular measures in preparation for the IPO, and 
consulting services in connection with strategic and M&A projects.  
The EBIT for the VMS segment amounted to € 104.8 million (previous year: € 108.0 million), which corresponds to a 
share of 71.3 % (previous year: 78.7 %) (before Group reconciliation). In addition to the earnings-reducing effects from 
resolving supply chain problems, higher R&D and administration expenses also contributed, which are primarily 
attributable to corporate functions and the acquisition of General Kinetics. This was partially compensated by lower 
warranty provisions. The EBIT margin was 19.8 % (previous year: 22.2 %). With a share of 17.2 % (before Group 
reconciliation), M&I generated an EBIT of € 25.3 million (previous year: € 16.6 million). The increase of 52.4 % was as a 
result of lower warranty provisions. This led to an EBIT margin of 8.5 % (previous year: 6.0 %). EBIT in the SB segment 
increased by 33.3 % to € 16.8 million (previous year: € 12.6 million). This resulted in an EBIT margin of 15.2 % (previous 
year: 13.9 %). In addition to the revenue development, the earnings improvement was realized due to a higher share of 
maintenance and similar services that have a higher gross margin.

The adjustments, amounting to € 46.9 million (previous year: € 66.2 million), are primarily due to the effects of purchase 
price allocations,  which mainly concerned depreciation on remeasured fixed assets and are assigned to the 
reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements. The activities initiated in fiscal year 2023 to align the Group with 
capital market requirements amounted to € 3.1 million. Expenses for termination benefits declined by € 3.1 Mio. € year-
on-year to € 1.7 million, and predominantly related to persons who left the Group’s management level in the fiscal year. 
Other adjustments mainly included consulting services in connection with organizational and operational optimization as 
well as costs in connection with RENK’s 150-year anniversary. 
RENK generated adjusted EBIT of € 150.0 million (previous year: € 144.3 million), a minor increase of 3.9 %. While the 
M&I and SB segments allowed adjusted EBIT to improve substantially, VMS was responsible for a moderate reduction of 
€ 7.0 Mio. € to € 106.4 million. For VMS, this meant a material decline in its adjusted EBIT margin to 20.1 % (previous 
year: 23.4 %). By comparison, M&I’s adjusted EBIT rose significantly by 37.5 % to € 28.4 million (previous year: 
€ 20.6 million). Overall, this resulted in a notable lift in M&I’s adjusted EBIT margin to 9.6 % (previous year: 7.5 %). The 
SB segment reported a substantial increase in adjusted EBIT of 29.5 % to € 17.3 million (previous year: € 13.4 million), 
resulting in a moderate improvement in its adjusted EBIT margin to 15.6 % (previous year: 14.7 %). 
RENK’s earnings after tax rose by 100.5 % to € 32.3 million (previous year: € 16.1 million). In addition to a decline in 
interest expense of € 1.9 million to € 39.8 Mio. € (previous year: € 41.7 Mio. €), primarily as a result of the repayment of 
the shareholder loan granted by the shareholder Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l., the positive effect was mainly a result of the 
decreased other financial loss, which was down by € 6.2 million at € 2.6 Mio. € (previous year:  € 8.7 Mio. €). In the 
previous year, this had included substantial expenses due to changes in the fair value of derivatives. Overall, this 
resulted in a notably improved financial result of € ‑42.4 million (previous year: € ‑50.4 million). Please refer to Note  
11. Income tax to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the development of income taxes. Adjusted 
earnings after tax amounted to € 76.4 million.

At 95.5 %, long-term committed capital predominantly consisted of intangible and tangible assets purchased through the 
acquisition of the former RENK AG and RENK America. As part of the purchase price allocations, the difference between 
the purchase price paid and carrying amounts acquired in previous years was allocated to goodwill, intangible assets as 
well as property, plant and equipment. 
At € 326.2 million (previous year: € 275.6 million), inventories accounted for 44.3 % (previous year: 39.9 %) of short-
term committed capital. The material increase was as a result of supply chain disruptions in the VMS segment, which led 
to higher levels of unfinished goods. The considerable rise in trade receivables of 12.9 % to € 163.3 million (previous 
year: € 144.7 million) and in contract assets of 15.6 % to € 96.6 million (previous year: € 83.5 million) was consistent 
with the growth in sales in the fiscal year. Cash and cash equivalents were largely reduced by the repayment of the 
shareholder loan granted by Triton in the amount of € 50.0 million and by € 34.5 million for the acquisition of General 
Kinetics.

As of the end of the fiscal year, equity amounted to € 403.9 million (previous year: € 324.5 million) and the equity ratio to 
27.4 % (previous year: 22.5 %). In addition to the profit for the fiscal year, this significant increase was as a result of an 
addition to the capital reserves of € 45.1 million. This was achieved by the voluntary contribution of the shareholder 
loans of € 30.0 million, plus accured interest, granted by the direct shareholder Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. Non-current 
liabilities represented 44.9 % of total equity and liabilities. A nominal amount of € 527.5 million of these non-current 
liabilities related to bond liabilities that financed the purchase price of the former RENK AG and RENK America. Equity 
and non-current liabilities were therefore tangibly higher than fixed assets.  
Short-term and long-term contract liabilities amounted to € 216.0 million in total (previous year: € 214.1 million). While 
the total amount was stable, the short-term share rose by € 30.6 million to € 171.8 million (previous year: 
€ 141.3 million) as a result of a higher share of payments on account by customers for goods and services to be 
provided in the short term. Other current and non-current provisions of € 51.3 million (previous year: € 76.5 million) 
predominantly related to warranty provisions. 
    
 
6. Financial Position 
6.1 
Principles and objectives of financial performance 
RENK’s financial management is performed centrally by the Treasury function. The aim of central financial management 
is to always ensure sufficient liquidity, limit financial risks and, in turn, increase the enterprise value. 
This includes securing liquidity for operating business, capital expenditures and targeted growth, as well as the financial 
hedging of currency risks. Liquidity was managed by central cash management. Please also refer to the information in

The development in free cash flow was substantially negative compared to the previous year. The change from a net 
cash inflow of € 63.5 million in 2022 to € 21.1 million in fiscal year 2023 essentially related to the rise in income taxes 
paid of € 17.5 million on account of the material improvement in operating earnings, the change in current assets, and 
NWC. 
The rise in NWC predominantly resulted from the increase in inventories of € 41.2 million. Disruptions in the supply 
chain prevented the completion and invoicing of work in progress as planned. Moreover, higher levels of raw materials 
and intermediate products were stockpiled in order to quickly mitigate the risk of short-term supplier dependencies. In 
addition, the increase in trade receivables and contract assets of € 47.8 million, which was consistent with the notable 
growth in sales, contributed to this development. Trade payables increase, which rose by € 55.4 million (previous year: 
€ 0.1 million), was unable to offset this effect. Customer payments received on account of orders remained at the same 
level as in the previous year. As a result, NWC in relation to sales amounted to 26.8 % after 26.0 % in the previous year. 
Investments in tangible and intangible assets of € 28.1 million (previous year: € 26.0 million) essentially related to 
production facilities in the fiscal year. Investments in tangible and intangible assets therefore amounted to 3.0 % of sales 
(previous year: 3.1 %).

In the reporting period, RENK generated a positive cash flow from operating activities of € 76.2 million (previous year: 
€ 115.8 million). This significant reduction despite the increase in profit before tax of € 31.8 million is essentially a result 
of the decline in depreciation and amortization of € 17.6 million, the increase in inventories of € 41.2 million and reversal 
of provisions in the amount of € ‑25.6 million. 
Cash flow from investing activities amounted to € ‑57.2 million (previous year: € ‑22.4 million) and, in addition to 
payments for production facilities, mainly related to the acquisition of General Kinetics in January 2023. 
As a result of the repayment of the shareholder loan to Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. in the amount of € 50.0 million, cash flow 
from financing activities declined substantially to € ‑80.0 million as of the reporting date (previous year: € ‑34.4 million). 
A positive factor in this context was interest expenses, which were down by € 0.0 million. 
The cash flow from operating activities was unable to cover capital expenditures and the repayment of the shareholder 
loan in the fiscal year. Taking currency effects and the change in the basis of consolidation caused by the acquisition of 
General Kinetics into account, cash and cash equivalents were therefore reduced by € 56.5 million to € 102.2 million.

7. Report on expected developments 
The global security situation faced mounting uncertainty continued in fiscal year 2023. This development is expected to 
persist or even intensify, driven by the threat of an escalation in the geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan, 
ongoing terror threats on land and at sea, regional instability in the Middle East, e.g., the armed conflict between Israel, 
Iran, and the terrorist organization Hamas, in North Africa, and in parts of Asia. The new so called defence supercycle 
(“super-cycle”), prompted the US and NATO to increase their defence budgets. Since then, global spending on defence 
has risen considerably. The business of the RENK Group is largely dependent on defence spending by its customers, 
which include governments, government authorities, international organizations, and entities that rely on government 
spending to buy the Group’s products and services. RENK is therefore susceptible to decisions made in government 
programs that are swayed by, for instance, social policy considerations, general macroeconomic conditions, or changes 
in government and administrative policy. As a result of the super-cycle, the Group anticipates a protracted growth phase 
in defence spending and procurement activities. However, the short-term forecasts for fiscal year 2024 are based on the 
assumption that RENK will neither be exposed to nor will benefit from significant effects of uncertainty or rising defence 
spending beyond contractual customer orders and the associated production costs in fiscal year 2024. We continue to 
assume significant order intake and growth in sales in line with our guidance in the years ahead. 
In addition to the general impact on the defence budget, the sanctions and export controls imposed by the EU, the U.S., 
the U.K., Canada, Japan, and other nations on Russian and Belarusian individuals, companies and organizations are 
having a substantial impact on the state of the global economy, further exacerbated by Russia’s countermeasures. 
Higher prices for oil and gas, bottlenecks in the supply of gas, supply chain disruption, market volatility, and economic 
uncertainty, in Europe in particular, have led to elevated rates of inflation and impacted the economy as a whole. 
Interruptions or disturbances in supply chains, logistical challenges, and shortages of raw materials and intermediate 
products had a negative impact on the real economy. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024, RENK assumes that it will not 
be exposed to any significant negative effects from the aforementioned sanctions. 
Defence-based spending and end markets with governmental customers are subject to political decision-making, which 
has a direct effect on the Group’s operating activities and, in. Political developments, such as changes of governments, 
sanctions, and trade policy in addressable markets such as the EU, U.K., and U.S., can affect the RENK Group’s ability 
to do business in these countries. In the EU and Germany, exports of goods of strategic significance, above all 
weaponry, military equipment, and dual-use goods, are subject to restrictive controls and approval requirements. 
Furthermore, new regulations on export control, the stricter enforcement of existing controls and the provisions of 
supplier countries such as Germany, France, the U.K., and the U.S. can have a substantial effect on the Group’s 
business activities. As a global manufacturer of drive solutions for various civilian and military applications and end 
markets, the Group abides by laws and guidelines. These regulations cover areas such as data protection, 
environmental protection, competition, taxation, employment, and export control. These laws and guidelines can arise at 
the national, bilateral, or even multilateral level or between participating jurisdictions, and their national or even 
extraterritorial application and relevance can vary. For forecast purposes, RENK assumes the changes in political 
developments in the countriess most relevant to its business activities will not have any negative effects compared to 
fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, the Group anticipates that government programs will not be cancelled, significantly 
delayed, or altered, and that no negative effects will result from reviews of government contracts. Furthermore, RENK 
assumes a stable legal and regulatory environment. 
As a global manufacturer of drive solutions for various civilian and military end markets, the Group’s business activities 
are subject to fluctuations in the world economy, especially for civilian solutions. Furthermore, some of the Group’s 
markets – for instance, energy generation, oil and gas, cement, and steel – react sensitively to cyclical changes in the 
economic landscape. In this context, decisions to buy products of the Group are largely a result of the output of these 
and other sectors. Demand in these sectors is influenced by changes in multiple factors, such as commodity prices, 
interest rates, fuel costs, energy requirements, and economic growth, which mainly affect the Group’s products for 
industrial markets. However, changes in the economic environment are unlikely to have any significant effect on the 
Group’s business activities in the short term as its main activities in the VMS and M&I segments tend to be more 
exposed to long-term rather than short-term economic risks. As a result, the forecasts for 2024 are based on the 
assumption that none of the Group’s significant orders will be cancelled or delayed. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
29 
 
Some of the Group’s business activities take place in highly competitive markets, such as Germany, the US and South 
America, the Middle East and China, which are affected by changes in market penetration, price competition, and the 
development and launch of new products, product designs, and technologies. On these markets, the Group’s 
competitive capability is primarily based on quality, innovation, the punctuality of delivery, design, and the ability to 
provide global technical support, repair expertise, and service. A similar competitive environment to fiscal year 2023 is 
assumed for forecast purposes. Negative effects on growth and profitability are not expected thanks to binding customer 
orders. The Group’s main activities in the segments VMS and M&I are characterized by long project lead times with 
accordingly long-term competition risks.  
The Group’s business activities are highly dependent on punctual delivery and on the appropriate quality and quantity of 
standard components (e.g., pumps, couplings, bearing or measurement and control technology) purchased from third-
party providers, the number of which is limited in some cases. The logistics processes of the Group therefore rely on the 
availability of components and an uninterrupted supply chain, as well as the sufficient quality of these individual 
components, in order to ensure that production plans are upheld and thereby to satisfy its contractual and anticipated 
future obligations, in particular the processing of its order backlog. The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic are 
still affecting the global economy, capital markets, and international trade, which has a direct impact on the availability of 
raw materials, parts, and components. The forecast for fiscal year 2024 assumes that supply chain restrictions will not 
have any negative effects on RENK’s business activities and that the raw materials and components required for 
processing will be available as needed and in the appropriate quality. The foundation for this is formed by unaltered 
supplier relationships. 
The Group’s production processes rely on various raw materials such as steel, aluminium, and tin, as well as 
subcomponents and components. Prices for a variety of raw materials and components have risen substantially in the 
past as a result of inflation, supply chain disruption, and other factors. This risk is partially, but not always, passed on to 
customers on the basis of agreed contractual clauses. In this context, the Group is exposed to the risk that the actual 
costs incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under fixed-price contracts may be higher than 
assumed when the contracts were entered into. For forecast purposes, the Group assumes that the effects of price 
increases for the most important raw materials and components will be unchanged compared to fiscal year 2023. 
Therefore, no significant negative effects are assumed. 
To satisfy its contractual and anticipated future obligations, in particular the processing of its order backlog, RENK relies 
on the recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel. In the past fiscal year, the Group succeeded in recruiting 
and retaining the necessary numbers of highly qualified employees. For the purposes of fiscal year 2024, the Group 
assumes that there will be no substantial personnel shortages with a negative impact on the satisfaction of its 
obligations to customers. 
The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed to currency risks. The Group generates a substantial share 
of its sales, and incurs a substantial share of its costs, in currencies other than the Euro. Its most significant foreign 
exchange risks relate to the US dollar (USD), the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Chinese renminbi yuan, and the 
Canadian dollar. In relation to the exchange rates for the past fiscal year, the Group assumes the following exchange 
rates for the coming fiscal year as of the reporting date.

Beyond the above conditions and assumptions on which the forecast for fiscal year 2024 is based, RENK assumes that 
there will be no unforeseen events that could result in a material or persistent negative impact on the Group’s business 
operations.

Based on the above forecast assumptions, RENK anticipates group revenues of between € 1,000.00 million and 
€ 1,100.00 million with an adjusted EBIT margin of between 16.0 % and 18.0 % for fiscal year 2024.

8. Report on the internal control and risk management system 
and essential risks and opportunities 
8.1 
Essential internal control system features  
The internal control system (ICS) represents an organizational context with the aim of ensuring proper accounting and 
associated financial reporting, as well as effective and efficient business processes, guaranteeing compliance with legal 
regulations and protecting assets from loss or misuse. As an integral part of the corporate structure of the RENK Group, 
the ICS provides an essential basis for governance and transparent business processes.  
The Group-wide ICS is based on the internationally accepted general concept of the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The COSO ICS was adapted to the Group's specific characteristics 
and individual circumstances to ensure seamless integration and customized implementation. 
As one of its duties of care, the Management Board has the overall responsibility for the Group ICS. This includes 
promoting awareness of the ICS, providing adequate resources to implement and maintain the ICS and monitoring the 
effectiveness of the ICS. The subsidiaries' managing directors are also obligated to comply with this duty of care and to 
ensure implementation and maintenance of an effective ICS in their companies. Together with the Management Board, 
the Supervisory Board of the RENK Group ensures that its effectiveness is monitored. Within the Supervisory Board of 
the RENK Group, this role falls to the Audit Committee as an independent monitoring body.  
The accounting-related ICS of the RENK Group is specifically focusing on ensuring proper financial reporting (correct 
presentation of the financial position, net assets and results of operations) and aims to ensure accuracy, completeness 
and timely preparation of financial reports as well as compliance with accounting standards. It takes into account the 
most significant risks and controls for the main accounting processes as well as relevant functional processes. These 
processes include not only accounting-related processes, but also purchasing, sales, valuation of inventories and HR, 
insofar as these have effects on financial reporting. 
Annual control tests are carried out to monitor appropriateness and effectiveness of these controls.  
Supporting the Management Board of the RENK Group the Centrally Risk Management Department and the ICS Group 
Coordinator hold the operational powers relating to all ICS-related activities. They define the scope of the ICS in a two-
stage approach comprised of company as well as process scoping. An annual review of the scope of application ensures 
that changes to the ICS are considered. At the level of the respective companies, local ICS officers act as the main point 
of contact for coordinating the ICS.  
Compliance with statutory requirements - including timely preparation of the Annual and Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the RENK Group - is ensured by way of policies, time limits and analyses at Group and Company level. 
The following material actions have been implemented within the Group's accounting-related ICS: 
 
Requirements for financial statements to inform subsidiaries about topics of relevance for preparing financial 
statements 
 
Detailed schedule and timeline for preparing the Annual Financial Statements 
 
Staff training regarding documentation of tested controls 
 
Controls in the process of preparing Annual and Consolidated Financial Statements (analyses, plausibility reviews, 
etc.) 
The process of preparing Annual and Consolidated Financial Statements as such is secured by way of numerous 
controls at local and central level, taking into account materiality aspects. They include, among others, automated 
controls, dual control principle, plausibility checks and monitoring controls. In addition, the ICS of the RENK Group 
considers the segregation of duty, the principle of transparency as well as the principle of minimum information. They 
are tested annually in a rolling process to provide the Management and Supervisory Boards with a basis to determine 
appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
32 
 
The Management Board receives a yearly report detailing appropriateness and effectiveness of processes and controls, 
identifying potential weaknesses and defined actions as well as planned improvements and the current status of the ICS. 
In addition, the Management Board provides the Audit Committee every year with a report on the annual ICS cycle. 
Despite careful structuring and comprehensive application of the ICS throughout the entire RENK Group, inherent risks 
remain with regard to its effectiveness due to subjective arbitrary decisions or other factors.  
8.2 
Opportunities and risks 
Every company faces both opportunities and risks in their business activities. The RENK Group systematically identifies, 
assesses and manages potential risks and opportunities that may materially affect its business activities. Taking into 
account its risk strategy, the RENK Group has implemented a Group-wide risk management system for early 
identification, assessment and response. An integral part of this is the risk early detection system, which identifies and 
assesses risks that may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern, and which are countered 
with suitable measures. The RENK Group describes risks as the potential danger that events, decisions or actions might 
hamper the attainment of defined targets of the Group or of a segment or the successful realization of strategies. In the 
case of risks, its impact on EBIT or equity is assessed. 
RENK deliberately incurs risks to take advantage of market opportunities if they materially contribute to increasing the 
Company's value and further its targets. By contrast, risks that may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as 
a going concern are avoided or, if this is not possible, mitigated by taking appropriate measures. To be able to ensure 
this, an effective risk early detection and risk management system (RMS) is imperative to provide relevant information to 
manage the Company at an early stage. Likewise, monitoring of risk-bearing capacity, i.e. the maximum risk exposure 
that the Company can bear over time without causing the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern, is 
another crucial factor in the RMS process. 
Deliberately addressing identified opportunities and risks as well as periodically monitoring them are intended to raise 
awareness of opportunities and risks, and ensuring an ongoing process of improvement. The RMS is based on a 
management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach and is aligned with the internationally accepted 
general concept of the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO). To ensure the 
best-possible application and effectiveness, the system was adapted to the Group's individual circumstances. 
The Management Board has ultimate responsibility for the RMS. It therefore is accountable for defining structure and 
methodology and also for actions to be taken to manage opportunities and risks. To reflect the organizational 
realignment, the reporting period for the fiscal year 2023 has therefore been set to every six months (previous year: 
three times a year). All RMS stakeholders have been notified of the RMS process. The Management Board also 
periodically reports to the Group's Audit Committee. The Management Board has delegated the ongoing review and 
updating of the RMS as well as implementation and monitoring of compliance with Group-wide standards to the Central 
Risk Management Department.  
The central risk management acts as a link between the legal entities, central functions and segments, the Management 
and Supervisory Boards and is responsible for ensuring a structured organizational and operational structure.  

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
33 
 
Figure 1: Risk reporting organizational chart 
 
The RMS process is comprised of risk identification, assessment and response phases. It generally applies to all 
companies in the RENK Group, irrespective of their size.  
The objective of risk identification within the RENK Group is to comprehensively and systematically record all significant 
risks to the Group, irrespective of their type. The legal entities' and central functions' risk owners and risk managers are 
accountable for identifying risks and opportunities within their area of responsibility and competence over the medium-
term (usually up to 3 years; in case of strategic and ESG risks, up to 10 years), whereby experts (risk deputies) provide 
support as required (bottom-up approach). The risk cluster heads or segment managers identify and assess risks for 
their respective areas of expertise by applying a top-down approach, including analyses of interdependencies of risks for 
the RENK Group.  
To identify risks, workshops and employee meetings are held, and early warning indicators and key financial figures are 
analyzed, among others.  
The RENK Group categorizes identified risks in seven clusters: strategic risks, operational risks, legal & compliance 
risks, reputational risks, technology & IT security risks, financial risks as well as ESG risks. All risks must undergo a 
quantitative assessment, but at least a qualitative one, with regard to their negative impact on the Group's EBIT. 
Aggregated individual risks that may exceed the materiality threshold due to interdependencies must also be reported. 
The risk manager is assigned with assessing whether risks which in and by themselves are deemed immaterial, might be 
material when aggregated.  
The risk is the product of the potential damage amount and the probability of its occurrence. When assessing the risk, a 
distinction is made between gross and net assessment, with actions already taken potentially mitigating the gross risk. 
The classification of risks is shown in the following risk matrix:

The net risk then represents the negative impact and probability of occurrence, taking into account any actions already 
initiated by the reporting date to mitigate the loss and/or reduce the probability of its occurrence. To manage the 
identified and assessed risks accordingly, the risk owner is assigned with initiating actions to avoid risks, reduce the 
negative impact and probability of its occurrence, to hedge the risks or to accept them. To deliberately accept risks, the 
Company-wide acceptance of risks or willingness to do so must be determined. In addition, coordination with the risk 
managers is necessary, who must submit the matter to central risk management. The final decision on risk acceptance 
is to be made by the Management Board, which considers the risk-bearing capacity in its decision-making process. 
The risk-bearing capacity determines the maximum risk value which the Company or the Group can bear over time 
without putting its own continued existence at risk. The risk-bearing capacity thus can also be referred to as a company's 
"risk coverage potential" or "resilience".   
The overall risk is the result of the aggregation of all individual risks within the group of companies. Aggregation is 
necessary as developments that may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern may also 
result from the interactions of multiple risks which in and by themselves do not cause the Group to cease to be able to 
continue as a going concern. To aggregate risks, different generally accepted quantitative and qualitative actions may be 
used. Given its corporate situation, RENK has decided to add up the amounts of expected losses of all individual risks. 
To duly consider the risk of multiple risks occurring at the same as well as the risk of interdependencies, RENK has used 
the highest percentage of the respective probability of occurrence as a basis for determining the respective amounts of 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
35 
 
expected losses of the individual risks. The aggregation result does not indicate that there is a significant threat to the 
Company as a going concern.  
As part of the semi-annual reporting system, the central risk management consolidates the Group risks and reports to 
the Management and Supervisory Boards. Unexpected risks that occur outside of regular reporting cycles and have a 
particularly high negative impact are reported immediately to the central risk management outside of the semi-annual 
risk process. 
The overall risk report prepared annually by central risk management and approved by the Management and 
Supervisory Boards is used as the basis for external reporting and enables the Management Board to assess the 
effectiveness of the RMS. The Supervisory Board's monitoring activities are also based on this reporting.  
The Internal Audit Department incorporates reported risks in its risk-based audit approach and provides support in 
monitoring the implementation of control measures.  
Significant risk areas: 
Based on the risk reporting to the RENK Group's Management Board, the risk situation as of the balance sheet date is

The following net risks may potentially cause medium or even high losses in terms of the net assets, financial position 
and results of operations of the RENK Group during the planning period. The risks are categorized as strategic risks, 
operational risks, legal & compliance risks, reputational risks, technology & IT security risks, financial risks and ESG 
risks. The respective risks are described in descending order depending on the significance of their effect on net assets, 
financial position and results of operations. Where the distribution of opportunities and risks across the segments is not 
explicitly described, any information on opportunities and risks relate to all segments of the RENK Group. 
Strategic risks 
The risks described below are among the material strategic risks of the RENK Group. 
Strategic market risks 
To secure and further expand the future market position, economic development and earnings position of the RENK 
Group, marketable new applications, products and systems must be continuously developed and made ready for the 
market as quickly as possible. Long development times and constantly changing regulatory conditions represent 
elements of uncertainty that may affect the economic success of current or future projects. Most notably, there is a risk 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
36 
 
that prototypes at the development stage will not be ready for the market. Moreover, changes in circumstances may 
result in a supply shortfall and a loss of market opportunities.  
To reinforce and further expand the market position of the RENK Group, the Company focuses on continuous 
communication with customers and clients, ongoing market monitoring as well as measures for constantly enhancing 
efficiency. In spite of implemented actions, said risks may have a high impact on the net assets, financial position and 
results of operations of the RENK Group. 
Macroeconomic environment  
Macroeconomic, political and geopolitical developments may adversely affect the current business and growth plans of 
the RENK Group. In particular, the conflict between China and Taiwan and the potentially resulting economic sanctions 
and export controls may restrict global economic activity and increase volatility on the global financial markets.  
To address these risks, RENK is continuously monitoring applicable export control laws and adjusting its sales strategies 
accordingly. Despite such measures, the development of the global economy involves risks that may moderately affect 
the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group. 
Operative risks 
The risks specified below are among the significant operative risks of the RENK Group. 
Production risks 
Maintaining production is pivotal for the economic success of the RENK Group. Events of force majeure or acts of 
sabotage may lead to material damage or loss of production or to delays or interruptions along the production chain. 
Moreover, they may cause reputational damage and the loss of customers and orders.   
The RENK Group has taken appropriate measures to protect against possible damage and associated business 
interruptions or production downtimes as well as other potential cases of damage and liability risks, such as obtaining 
insurance or increasing safety precautions inside and outside the production sites. The site-specific combinations of 
personnel and organizational actions implemented by the RENK Group are supplemented by structural and mechanical 
property protection as well as electronic surveillance equipment. However, the effects of force majeure or sabotage may 
moderately affect the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group. 
Due to the high level of specialization of each production site, a production outage at any one site may compromise 
delivery capacities. The RENK Group addresses this risk through a global, strategically optimized production landscape, 
an expansion of its plant network through mutual enablement and continuous intra-group communication. Despite 
countermeasures, the risk moderately affects RENK's net assets, financial position and results of operations.  
Procurement 
The procurement of raw materials, parts and components entails the risk of unexpected delivery disruptions, delays or 
bottlenecks, quality issues, increasing purchasing prices, cyberattacks on suppliers or the loss of a supplier of 
precursors and intermediates, raw materials or energy. 
Focusing on quality, costs and delivery reliability, the procurement department of the RENK Group ensures the 
Company's optimum supply with goods and services. The risk potential may be reduced through careful selection of 
high-performing suppliers, periodic supplier reviews as well as active supplier monitoring, precise specifications and 
quality requirements, reliability checks as well as adequate reserve stocks. In addition, supplies are ensured by 
developing alternative sources for goods from critical suppliers and pursuing category strategies. The RENK Group 
addresses resource bottlenecks with continuous improvements to stabilize the supply chain, as well as highly specific 
and detailed demand forecasting and close collaboration with suppliers. However, should the supply security be at risk 
despite all these measures, this may moderately affect the net assets, financial position and results of operations. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
37 
 
Additional procurement risks are caused by considerable market price fluctuations for raw materials and energy, 
affecting all segments of the RENK Group.  
The RENK Group is addressing these risks with long-term material and price hedging agreements and by developing 
alternative supply sources and competitive tenders. In addition, where possible, the RENK Group is adjusting its pricing 
strategy. Due to the current high volatility, changes in market prices can moderately affect net assets and results of 
operations. 
Personnel 
The successful implementation of the sophisticated growth-oriented corporate strategy, the realization of financial 
objectives and the sustained economic success of the RENK Group depend on the expertise and experience of its highly 
qualified staff and specialists. Significant personnel risks in this context include a shortage of skilled workers, the difficult 
search for the right executives, specialists and talent with the required commercial, technical or industry-specific skills 
and aging of the workforce. 
To mitigate these risks, RENK conducts targeted personnel marketing to externally communicate the Company's 
strengths. Additional actions taken to mitigate risks include the continuous further development of competitive, fair pay 
with performance-linked incentive systems, modern HR management as well as structured technical and method-specific 
training and development. The personnel risks mentioned may also moderately affect the Company's financial position 
and results of operations. 
Legal & compliance risks 
The risks described below are among the significant legal & compliance risks of the RENK Group. 
Warranty and liability risks 
The quality of the products offered by the RENK Group is a major factor for customers' purchasing decisions. To assure 
this quality in the long term, the Company uses a certified quality management system as well as additional quality-
enhancing processes. Despite said actions, the risk remains that poor quality products are delivered, triggering a 
product liability risk. The use of defective products may also lead to damage and liability claims by customers or to 
unscheduled repairs as well as to reputational damage for RENK  
To mitigate these risks, the RENK Group focuses on strict quality assurance procedures, continuous product and 
production enhancement processes, as well as ongoing training to ensure qualified staff. Contractual risks for the RENK 
Group are mitigated through the use of specialized legal support. In addition, selected product liability risks are insured 
as well. Specific risks may moderately affect net assets and results of operations of the RENK Group.  
Compliance 
As a global company, the RENK Group has to comply with different laws and regulations worldwide. To ensure that they 
are adhered to, the Company has implemented a Group-wide compliance management system. In the event of 
corruption or failure to adhere to anti-corruption laws, money laundering incidents or identified facts that do not meet 
compliance management systems' requirements, adequate action is taken without undue delay.  
The RENK Group cooperates with government authorities when investigating potential compliance violations and 
adequately addresses detected weaknesses. Periodic Group-wide compliance risk assessments (top-down and bottom-
up) as well as case-based risk analyses serve to identify systemic and company-specific compliance risks. Clearly 
defined responsibilities, internal policies, such as the Code of Conduct, and ongoing training provide support for staff in 
acting compliant and assist in averting losses for the RENK Group. Compliance violations may moderately affect the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group and also its reputation. 
In addition, the RENK Group is exposed to risks that may arise due to regulatory or legislative changes on the national 
or European level, for example due to new laws or changed legal parameters in export controls or due to export 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023

38 
 
restrictions. Moreover, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions might be imposed on countries 
where the RENK Group is operating. Even though regulatory requirements are monitored constantly, any changes may 
moderately affect the Company's financial position and results of operations.   
Technology & IT security risks 
The risks described below are among the significant risks of the RENK Group in the area of technology and IT security. 
IT cyber security 
The IT systems used in all areas of the RENK Group are of major significance for the Company. The functionality of 
business processes and as a consequence, maintaining business operations, depend on the availability of IT systems, 
whose functions can be fully or partially impaired by cyberattacks. Additional risks are caused by unauthorized access to 
IT systems, modification or removal of sensitive business data or lack of functionality of processes and data.  
To ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and IT systems, the RENK Group has implemented an 
information security management system (ISMS) that has been certified under the internationally recognized ISO 27001 
and BSI IT-Grundschutz standards. 
Staff are sensitized to handling business-related information with care as an important issue for the RENK Group. As a 
consequence, audits and awareness measures are imperative. In addition, the Company uses integrated hardware and 
software protection systems and a Cyber Defense Center for continuous active monitoring. 
Despite the implemented countermeasures, the risks mentioned may moderately affect net assets, financial position and 
results of operations. 
Financial risks 
The risks described below are among the significant financial risks of the RENK Group. 
Liquidity risk 
The liquidity risk describes the risk that the RENK Group will be unable to satisfy its payment obligations when due. This 
is the case if the required financial resources cannot be covered by existing equity or debt financing. In fiscal year 2023, 
the financing requirements of the RENK Group were fully covered by the existing funds. However, there is always the 
risk that lenders may extraordinarily terminate loans/bonds/financing facilities in the event of non-compliance with 
financial covenants. As a measure safeguarding liquidity, the Treasury Department’s liquidity planning for the RENK 
Group is performed on a rolling basis by using the Group's cash pooling to optimize financial resources.  
To secure orders and bids, the RENK Group may be reliant on guarantees and sureties issued by banks. If RENK fails to 
obtain sufficient lines from financial institutions for the provision of securities and guarantees, the planned growth of 
RENK could be at risk.  
Generally, the risk of rising interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities and falling interest rates on interest-bearing 
assets arises from variable interest agreements and generally from short-term financial instruments. These interest rate 
risks are managed by early and ongoing financial planning and diversification of financing sources. All financial liabilities 
as of December 31, 2023, were agreed with fixed interest rates. However, the fair value of the derivative embedded in 
the bond is subject to changes in the market interest rate. Since this embedded derivative is measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, the other financial result would be impacted by interest rate changes. Despite the low probability of 
occurrence, the liquidity risks mentioned, both individually and in total, may moderately affect net asset, financial 
position and result of operations. In addition, the RENK Group does not apply hedge accounting for economic hedging 
relationships in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023. 
 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
39 
 
Default risks 
Counterparty risks arise from the investment of excess liquidity and entering into derivative contracts. A partial or total 
default of a counterparty, for example with regard to its obligation to repay interest and capital, would negatively affect 
the financial position and result of operations of RENK Group AG. To minimize the default risk associated with these 
financial instruments, banks are generally used that have at least a credit rating within the investment grade range from 
one of the globally active rating agencies. The creditworthiness of the banks is continuously monitored. In addition, 
RENK Group AG defines investment limits for each bank and market value limits for derivative financial instruments. 
Their amount is based on the credit rating assessment of the rating agencies of the respective bank. Compliance with 
the limits is continuously monitored. 
Currency risk 
Operating results therefore are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, most of all the USD/EUR exchange rate. RENK 
Group AG therefore uses derivatives to reduce the currency risk. The income and cost risks due to currency fluctuations 
are curtailed by way of purchases and sales in the corresponding foreign currencies and also by forward exchange 
transactions.  
The functional currency of the RENK Group is the Euro. As a company operating internationally, the RENK Group is thus 
exposed to financial risks due to exchange rate changes. This can result in financial losses if assets denominated in a 
currency with a declining exchange rate lose value and/or liabilities in a currency with a increasing exchange rate 
become more expensive. Exchange rate fluctuations can occur in purchases or sales in foreign currency. Therefore, 
exchange rate fluctuations may affect the results of operations of the RENK Group. External and internal transactions, in 
which products and services are delivered to third parties and to companies within the RENK Group, can be associated 
with cash inflows and outflows that are conducted in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective 
RENK Group company (transaction risk). As far as cash outflows of the respective RENK Group company in a foreign 
currency are not offset by cash inflows from the operating business in the same currency, the remaining net exchange 
rate risk is hedged individually by appropriate derivative financial instruments, in particular forward transactions and 
currency swaps. Conversion risks are generally not hedged. 
Tax risks 
Because of its global business activities, the RENK Group is exposed to tax risks due to different or changing legislation 
and tax audits, potentially entailing a risk of additional taxes, interest and penalties. To identify and mitigate tax risks 
early, RENK Group has implemented organizational measures in order to ensure compliance with tax regulations. These 
include a Global Tax Center as well as close cooperation with external tax consultants. Despite countermeasures, tax 
risks might moderately affect the net assets, financial position and results of operations. 
Opportunity management 
Opportunities through increased defense spending 
The military conflicts between Russia and the Ukraine and in Israel are likely to lead to increased defense spending, 
especially in NATO member states. As a consequence of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, a number of 
countries in Western and Eastern Europe are supporting the Ukraine with military equipment from their own stocks, but 
also has increased their willingness to improve the military equipment of their own armed forces for national and alliance 
defense. In the short and medium term, this might lead to an increase in both new and additional defense procurement 
projects, presenting business potential for the RENK Group, especially in Europe. 
Opportunities through market expansion 
Due to the increasingly global market strategy of the RENK Group, in addition to selected European countries especially 
the markets in the U.S., in India, in Japan and - in the energy sector - in China represent major market development 
opportunities. RENK is focusing on strategic planning and execution in order to ensure its ability to serve these markets 
more effectively and to successfully develop new markets. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
40 
 
Opportunities through positive reputation 
At present, a significant increase in public interest in the defense industry is enhancing the positive reputation of the 
RENK Group. This development opens not only new market opportunities, but also opportunities in the area of workforce 
expansion. The Company's positive reputation is increasingly attracting well-qualified workers, which in turn enables the 
recruitment of skilled staff. This opportunity thus actively counteracts the shortage of skilled workers and possible loss of 
specialist knowledge and expertise. 
Opportunities through better aftersales margins  
Increased spare parts sales, maintenance and repair services as well as other after-sales services give the RENK Group 
an opportunity to generate higher margins. Higher aftersales margins also can contribute to reduce dependence on new 
product sales and diversify the Company's business model. The opportunities in this area will have a positive impact on 
the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group, especially in the Marine & Industry 
segment. 
Overall assertion 
The overall opportunity and risk situation of the RENK Group is evaluated by the Management Board considering all 
material or individual risks and, if necessary, weighing them up against any emerging opportunities. According to the 
Management Board’s assessment, the risk position of the RENK Group has deteriorated compared to the prior year. 
Procurement risks, in particular due to market price fluctuations, lack of adherence to delivery dates and quality 
problems, and the associated risks for the production processes of RENK, are contributing to a deteriorating risk 
situation. Overall, there are no known risks that alone or in combination with other risks might be able to cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

9. Explanations to the Annual Financial Statements of RENK 
Group AG 
The annual financial statements of RENK Group AG are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German 
Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch”), while the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with 
IFRS. As the parent company of the Group, RENK Group AG performs service and holding functions in addition to 
operational management functions. Its economic development is mainly dependent on the business performance of the 
operating Group companies. The economic framework of RENK Group AG, as well as its risks and opportunities, are 
essentially the same as those of the Group, as described in the economic report. The outlook for the Group directly 
influences by our expectations for RENK Group AG. The above explanations for the RENK Group therefore also apply to 
RENK Group AG. 
As of December 31, 2023, RENK Group AG is a wholly owned subsidiary of the TRITON private equity group and, as the 
ultimate German company, indirectly holds all shares in the operating RENK companies, headed by RENK GmbH, 
Augsburg, through RENK FinCo GmbH, Augsburg. The IPO on February 7, 2024 reduced this share to around 67 %. 
In conjunction with the RENK Group’s activities as a holding company (listed since February 7, 2024), RENK Group AG 
has entered into service agreements with RENK GmbH. From reimbursements of costs related to the IPO, revenue and 
associated expenses are recognized. 
RENK Group AG employed two members of staff as of the end of 2023 (previous year: zero) (including members of the 
Board of Management).

The results of operations in fiscal year 2023 are characterized by reimbursements of costs related to the IPO in the amount of 
€ 1,562 thousand (previous year: € 0 thousand) and other operating expenses, which rose significantly by € 2,440 thousand. 
This considerable increase from € 179 thousand in the previous year to € 2,618 thousand for fiscal year 2023 is essentially 
resulting from the significant rise in consulting costs of € 1,615 thousand (previous year: € 0 thousand), in particular with respect 
to on account of the IPO in February 2024. In this context, there was also a material increase of € 448 thousand in the costs for

42 
 
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of € 622 thousand (previous year: € 175 thousand). Personnel 
expenses of € 545 thousand include wages and salaries for the first time. No taxes on income were reported as the profit before 
tax was negative. The substantial increase in net accumulated losses, of € 1,650 thousand to € 1,868 thousand, is therefore 
essentially resulting from high other operating expenses. Additionally, the net loss of € 180 thousand in the previous year was 
carried forward.

In addition to the interest in the affiliated company RENK FinCo GmbH and equity, the balance sheet of RENK Group AG mainly 
comprises receivables from shareholders and liabilities to Group companies. 
The net assets and financial position of RENK Group AG are characterized by a voluntary contribution by Rebecca BidCo S.à 
r.l. of € 45,090 thousand, which was paid into the capital reserve during the fiscal year. The capital contributions were made in 
the form of the outstanding amount arising from a loan granted to an affiliated company in 2020. RENK Group AG, in turn, 
passed the received capital on to another subsidiary, resulting in a corresponding increase in the carrying amounts o it’s 
investment.  
The rise in current assets of € 7,884 thousand is essentially attributable to costs passed on in connection with the IPO in 
February 2024 in the amount of € 2,530 thousand (previous year: € 0 thousand), payments on account of € 1,850 thousand 
(previous year: € 0 thousand) and VAT receivables of € 1,103 thousand (previous year: € 0 thousand). 
As a result of the above voluntary contribution by Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. of € 45,090 thousand, by way of resolution of 
September 20, 2023, which was recognized in the company’s unutilized capital reserves in accordance with Section 272 para. 2 
No. 4 of the German Commercial Code, the equity of RENK Group AG increased notably from € 312,091 thousand to 
€ 355,531 thousand. By way of a resolution passed on August 9, 2023 and entry in the commercial register on August 23, 2023, 
the subscribed capital of the company was increased significantly by € 99,975 thousand from € 25 thousand to 
€ 100,000 thousand. This is a capital increase from own funds that took place prior to the conversion to a stock corporation.  

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
A. Combined Management Report
 
43 
 
The subscribed capital of the company of € 100,000 thousand became the share capital of the stock corporation that the 
company was converted into. 
On the equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet, liabilities to affiliated companies rose significantly by € 3,915 thousand 
from € 100 thousand in the previous year to € 4,015 thousand as a result of the loan granted by RENK GmbH. Furthermore, for 
the first time, there are liabilities for serviced received of € 2,849 thousand as of the end of the year (previous year: 
€ 0 thousand). Moreover, for the first time there are VAT liabilities of € 985 thousand. Also, there are pension provisions of 
€ 149 thousand for the first time as of December 31, 2023. The settlement amount is offset against the fair value of plan assets, 
which cannot be accessed by any creditors and that cover the pension entitlements of former employees.  
Essentially as a result of transactions mentioned above, the total assets of RENK Group AG amounted to € 365,333 thousand 
as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: € 312,351 thousand). 
Given its ties with the companies of the RENK Group and on the basis of the IPO in February 2024, the performance of RENK 
Group AG is deemed consistently positive. 
The Management Board proposes to use the distributable profit as shown in the financial statements of RENK Group AG as of 
December 2023 in the amount of € 30,000 thousand to pay a dividend of € 0,30 per share in profit and to pay the dividend out of 
the capital reserve according to Section 272 para. 2 no. 4 HGB.

Risks and Opportunities 
RENK Group AG participates in the risks and opportunities of its subsidiaries. The extent of this participation is dependent on 
the respective interest held in them. Therefore, it is exposed to the risk of a potential impairment of its investments. Please also 
see 8.2 Report on Risks and Opportunities. 
In addition, obligations can arise under the hard letter of comfort issued for the subsidiary RENK FinCo GmbH, which is also 
effective for fiscal year 2023. This states that RENK Group AG is required to manage RENK FinCo GmbH and provide it with 
financial resources such that it is always able to satisfy obligations to its creditors entered into in the reporting period. To the 
extent that such creditors also include controlling companies, the letter of comfort acts in their favor accordingly. 
As the parent company of the RENK Group, RENK Group AG is included in the Group-wide risk management system (see 
8.2 Report on Risks and Opportunities). From the relationship with its affiliated companies, legal or contractual arrangements 
(mainly financing arrangements) may lead to obligations as well as impairments of investments.  
9.3 
Forecast 
The future economic development of RENK Group AG is closely linked to the ongoing operating performance of the Group. The 
net profit of loss of the year serves as key performance indicator.  
In the future, RENK Group AG will incur expenses for the remuneration of the members of the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board and for further personnel, for tax payments, for financing utilized, and for its own holding organization. 
Furthermore, income will be generated by the performance of services for other Group companies. Overall, net loss of the year 
has significantly deteriorated compared to the previous year resulting from the performance of specific holding functions. As 
there will be additional holding functions taken over, we anticipate a further considerable deterioration of net loss in 2024.  
For fiscal year 2023, we are striving for a distribution ratio of around 40 % of the adjusted profit for the year of the RENK Group. 
Given its ties with the companies of the RENK Group, the general expectations for RENK Group AG reflect those in the forecast 
for the RENK Group (see 7. Report on Expected Developments).

10. Takeover-relevant information 
Explanatory report of the Management Board in accordance with Section 176 para. 1 sentence 1 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG) on the information relevant to the takeover in accordance with Sections 289a para. 1 and 315a 
para. 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) as of the balance sheet date December 31, 2023. 
Composition of the subscribed capital 
As of December 31, 2023, the subscribed capital (share capital) of RENK Group AG in accordance with Sections 6 para. 
1 and 2, 7 para. 1 of the Articles of Association amounts to € 100,000,000.00 (in words: one hundred million Euro) and is 
divided into 100,000,000 bearer shares with no par value (no-par value shares). The shares are fully paid up. There are 
no different classes of shares.  
All shares have the same rights and obligations. The rights and obligations of shareholders arise in detail from the 
regulations of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in particular from Sections 12, 53a et seqq., 118 et seqq. and 
186 AktG. 
According to Section 7 para. 2 of the Articles of Association, the shareholders' right to certification of their shares is 
excluded to the extent that this is permitted by law and certification is not required according to the rules of a stock 
exchange on which the share is admitted to trading. The company is entitled to issue share certificates that represent 
individual shares (individual shares) or several or all shares (collective shares). An entitlement of the shareholders to the 
issuance of profit share and renewal coupons is excluded. 
Restrictions affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares 
Each share grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 20 para. 1 of the Articles of 
Association and determines the shareholders' share of the company's profits. Excluded from this are treasury shares 
held by the company, under which the company has no rights in accordance with Section 71b AktG; as of  
December 31, 2023, the company did not hold any such treasury shares. In the cases covered by Section 136 AktG, 
voting rights from the affected shares are excluded by law. Legal restrictions on voting rights may still arise in the event 
of violations of notification obligations in accordance with Sections 20 para. 7 and 21 para. 4 AktG. Likewise, violations 
of notification obligations within the meaning of Sections 33 para. 1, 2, 38 para. 1 and 39 para. 1 of the German 
Securities Trading Act (WpHG) can mean that rights from shares and also voting rights do not exist at least temporarily 
in accordance with Section 44 WpHG.  
The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection ("BMWK") may review the direct or indirect 
acquisition of company shares by a foreign acquirer if the acquirer will directly or indirectly hold 10 % or more of the 
company’s voting rights after the acquisition. According to the regulations in Sections 60 et seqq. of the Foreign Trade 
and Payments Ordinance (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung), the intended acquisition must be reported in writing to the 
BMWK, which will only approve the acquisition if there are no concerns regarding the essential security interests of the 
Federal Republic of Germany. Whether the provisions of Sections 60 et seqq. of the Foreign Trade and Payments 
Ordinance are applicable depends on whether the target company of the acquisition is active in one of the sectors listed 
in Section 60 para. 1 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance. If Section 60 of the Foreign Trade Ordinance is not 
applicable, the BMWK can still prohibit or restrict the acquisition if this is likely to affect the public order or security of the 
Federal Republic of Germany, another member state of the European Union or in relation to projects or programs of 
Union interest (cross-sector review, Sections 55 et seqq. of the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance). 
In connection with Article 19 para. 11 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation), there are certain 
trading bans on the purchase and sale of RENK Group AG shares, particularly a temporal context with the publication of 
financial results.  
In the past, members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and certain employees of the RENK Group were 
given the opportunity to participate indirectly in the company ("MEP Participants") as part of a management equity

program by purchasing shares in a so-called MEP Pooling vehicle, which in turn has an indirect stake in the company.

are 12 months and start with the IPO of RENK Group AG, which took place on February 7, 2024.

restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares.

Type of voting rights control when employees hold shares in the capital and do not exercise their control rights 
directly 
Employees who hold RENK Group AG shares exercise their control rights, like other shareholders, directly in 
accordance with the statutory provisions and the Articles of Association.  
The MEP Participants in the 2020 employee participation program exercise their voting rights in the company indirectly 
by exercising their voting rights in the MEP Pooling vehicle. 
Statutory provisions and provisions of the Articles of Association regarding the appointment and dismissal of 
Management Board members and amendments to the Articles of Association 
The appointment and dismissal of members of the Management Board are regulated in Sections 84 and 85 AktG, 
Sections 31 and 33 of the German Co-determination Act (MitbestG) and Section 8 of the Articles of Association. In 
accordance with Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Management Board consists of one or more 
members; the number of Management Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. The members of the 
Management Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum period of five years; reappointments are 
permitted. The Articles of Association additionally stipulate that the Supervisory Board can appoint a Chairman of the 
Management Board and a Deputy Chairman and can issue Rules of Procedure for the Management Board. 
According to Sections 119 para. 1 no. 6, 133, 179 para. 1 sentence 1 AktG, any amendment to the Articles of 
Association requires a resolution by the Annual General Meeting. According to Section 6 para. 6 of the Articles of 
Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized to amend the company's Articles of Association after each capital 
increase has been carried out or after the expiry of the authorization period without using the authorized capital (cf. 
Section 6 para. 4 of the Articles of Association) or the conditional capital (cf. Section 6 para. 5 of the Articles of 
Association).  
According to Section 179 para. 2 AktG, resolutions by the Annual General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association 
require a majority of at least three quarters of the share capital represented when the resolution is passed, unless the 
Articles of Association specify a different capital majority. Section 21 of the Articles of Association of RENK Group AG 
determines a different capital majority in this regard. According to Section 21 sentence 1 of the Articles of Association, 
the Annual General Meeting passes its resolutions with a simple majority, unless mandatory statutory provisions or the 
Articles of Association stipulate a higher majority or further requirements. Section 21 sentence 2 of the Articles of 
Association further provides: If the law requires a capital majority in addition to the majority of votes for resolutions of the 
Annual General Meeting, a simple majority of the share capital represented when the resolution is passed is sufficient, to 
the extent permitted by law. However, this simple capital majority according to Section 21 sentence 2 of the Articles of 
Association does not apply in particular to a change in the object of the company, since only a capital majority greater 
than three quarters could be specified in the Articles of Association in this respect pursuant to Section 179 para. 2 sen-
tence 2 AktG. Further capital majorities that are legally required for an amendment to the Articles of Association of at 
least three quarters of the share capital represented when the resolution is passed, in addition to the simple majority of 
votes, shall remain unaffected; this applies in particular to resolutions on the creation of conditional capital, Section 193 
para. 1 sentence 1 AktG, the creation of authorized capital, Section 202 para. 2 sentence 2 AktG, a capital increase from 
own funds, Section 207 para. 2 sentence 1 in conjunction with Section 182 para. 1 sentence 2 AktG, the reduction of the 
share capital, Section 222 para. 1 sentence 1 AktG, as well as Section 229 para. 3 in conjunction with Section 222 para. 
1 sentence 1 AktG, and the cancellation of shares in the cases of Section 237 para. 2 sentence 1 in conjunction with 
Section 222 para. 1 sentence 1 AktG. 
Powers of the Management Board to issue or repurchase shares

of the bonds option or conversion rights for up to 50.000,000 new shares of the Company with a pro rata amount of the 
registered share capital of up to €1.00 further subject to the terms and conditions of the respective warrant-linked or 
convertible bonds and/or terms and conditions of the profit-sharing certificates to be defined by the Management Board. 
Other than in Euro, the bonds may also be issued - subject to the limitation to the corresponding equivalent value in euro 
- in a foreign legal currency. The bonds may also be issued by companies which are controlled by the Company or in 
which it holds a majority interest: in such case the Management Board is authorized. subject to the consent of the 
Supervisory Board, to assume on behalf of the Company the guarantee for the bonds and to grant the holders of such 
bonds option and/or conversion rights for shares of the Company and to effect further declarations and acts as are 
required for a successful issue. 
The issues of the bonds may in each case be divided into partial bonds with equal entitlement amongst themselves. The 
issue of bonds may also be affected against non-cash contribution provided that the value of the non-cash contribution is 
equal to the issue price and such issue price is not substantially lower than the hypothetical market value of the bonds 
calculated using recognized financial calculation methods. The Management Board was authorized, subject to the 
consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders for bonds to exclude fractional 
amounts, resulting from subscription ratio from the statutory subscription right of the shareholders for the bonds. 
The Management Board is also authorized, subject to the consent the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription right of 
the shareholders for bonds to the extent required to grant the holders of warrant-linked bonds. convertible bonds, or

of all such instruments) issued by the Company or by companies which are controlled by it or in which it holds a majority 
interest, a subscription right in the scope to which they would be entitled after exercise of the rights and/or fulfilment of 
the obligations.  
Beyond that, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the 
subscription right of the shareholders, for bonds to issue bonds against non-cash contribution in particular – but without 
limitation– to acquire companies, parts of companies or interests in companies or receivables. 
The Management Board is also authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription 
right of the shareholders for bonds to issue bonds against cash payment, provided that such sale is affected at an issue 
price which is not substantially lower than the hypothetical market value of the partial bonds calculated using 
recognized. in particular financial calculation methods. However, such authorization to exclude the subscription rights 
shall apply only provided that the shares issued to fulfil the option or conversion rights and/or in the case of fulfilment of 
the conversion obligation represents no more than 10 % of the registered share capital. Decisive for the threshold of 
10 % is the registered share capital figure on the date when this authorization becomes effective. In the event that the 
registered share capital figure should be lower at the time when this authorization is exercised, such lower value shall be 
decisive. Such amount shall include the pro rata amount of the registered share capital (i) represented by shares which 
have been or will be issued during the term of this authorization until its exercise out of an authorized capital subject to 
exclusion of the subscription right pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 AktG, (ii) represented by treasury shares 
of the Company which have been or will be sold during the term of this authorization until its exercise on the basis of 
authorizations pursuant to Section 71 para. 1 no. 8 AktG subject to exclusion of the subscription right of the 
shareholders pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 AktG and (iii) represented by shares which have been or are to 
be issued to fulfil warrant-linked or convertible bonds respectively profit-sharing certificates conferring conversion or 
option rights or establishing a conversion obligation to the extent that such bonds were issued during the term of this 
authorization until its exercise based on another authorization subject to the exclusion of the statutory subscription right

In principle, shareholders are to be granted subscription rights. The statutory subscription rights of the 
shareholders may be granted in such a way that the new shares are taken over by a credit institution and/or one 
or more other companies that fulfill the requirements of Section 186 para. 5 AktG (Finanzinstitute) or a 
syndicate of such credit or financial institutions with the obligation to offer them indirectly to the shareholders for 
subscription within the meaning of Section 186 para. 5 AktG. However, the Management Board is authorized, 
subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the statutory subscription rights of the shareholders

at the time of the issuance of the new shares the Company’s shareholder meeting has not yet resolved upon the 
appropriation of profits for such fiscal year. 
Treasury Shares 
The Company’s shareholder meeting held on September 18, 2023 authorized the Management Board, subject to the 
consent of the Supervisory Board, to purchase treasury shares up to a total amount equal to no more than 10 % of the 
registered share capital. Decisive for the threshold of 10 % shall be the registered share capital figure on the date when 
this authorization becomes effective. If the registered share capital figure is lower at the time when this authorization is 
exercised, such lower value shall be decisive. In this connection, the shares purchased on the basis of this authorization 
together with other shares of the Company which the Company has already purchased and still holds shall not exceed 
10 % of the respective registered share capital existing at any one time. The authorization may also be exercised by 
companies which are controlled by the Company or in which it holds a majority interest or by third parties for the account 
of the Company or companies controlled by it or in which it holds a majority interest. The authorization may be exercised 
to the full extent of repurchases thereby authorized or in partial amounts, on one or several occasions. 
The purchase shall be affected on the stock market by way of public purchase offer to all shareholders of the Company 
or a public solicitation to submit sales offers, respectively, by using derivatives and/or from a credit or financial 
institution. 
If the purchase of the shares is affected on the stock market, the purchase price (excluding ancillary purchasing costs) 
may not be more than 1 0% higher or lower than the opening auction trading price of the shares of the Company in Xetra 
trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the respective 
trading day. If no opening auction is carried out, the first trading price paid for the shares of the Company in Xetra 
trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the respective 
trading day shall be decisive. 
If a purchase is affected via a public purchase offer, the Company may either publish a formal offer or publicly request 
shareholders to submit offers to sell. The offered purchase price (excluding ancillary purchasing costs) may not be more 
than 10 % higher or lower than the arithmetic mean value of the closing prices (closing prices of the share of the 
Company as determined in Xetra trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra) on the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange for the last three trading days preceding the publication of the purchase offer or the request to submit offers. If 
the stock price of the shares of the Company deviates materially from the relevant price after the offer has been 
published, the offer may be adjusted. In this case, the arithmetic mean value of the share (closing prices of the share of 
the Company as determined in Xetra trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra if a closing auction 
does not take place, the respective last paid stock exchange prices) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for the last three 
trading days preceding the publication of the adjustment shall be decisive. 
The repurchase volume may be limited. To the extent the shares offered for purchase by the shareholders exceed the 
total amount of the Company’s purchase offer, acceptance shall take place in the ratio of the total amount of the 
purchase offer to the total quantity of shares offered by the shareholders for the relevant purchase price or a lower price. 
In addition, it may also be provided that preferential acceptance is given for smaller numbers of up to 100 offered shares 
per shareholder. The purchase offer or request to submit offers may contain further terms and conditions. 
The acquisition of treasury shares can also be effected by way of (i) the acquisition of options entitling the Company to 
acquire shares of the Company (call-options), (ii) the sale of options obliging the Company in the event of the options 
being exercised to acquire shares of the Company (put-options), and/or (iii) entering into forward purchase agreements 
relating to shares of the Company which have a period of more than two stock exchange trading days between the day 
of the conclusion of the respective forward purchase agreement and its settlement with shares of the Company (call-
options, put-options and forward purchase agreements). A combination of different derivatives is permissible. 
 
The terms and conditions of the derivatives have to stipulate that they are only served with shares of the 
Company that have been purchased over the stock exchange in compliance with the principle of equal 
treatment. The purchase price (not including ancillary acquisition costs) paid for such shares of the Company, 
may not be more than 10 % higher or lower than the opening auction trading price or the first trading price of the 
shares of the Company in Xetra trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra on the Frankfurt

Stock Exchange on the respective trading day. If no opening auction is carried out, the first trading price paid for 
the shares of the Company in Xetra trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra on the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the respective trading day shall be decisive. 
 
The purchase price per share stipulated in the derivatives may not be more than 10 % higher or lower than the 
arithmetic mean value of the closing prices (closing prices of the share of the Company as determined in Xetra 
trading or on any comparable trading system substituting Xetra) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for the last 
three trading days preceding the conclusion of the respective derivative agreement. In addition, the purchase 
price paid by the Company for call-options or forward purchase agreements, or the respective option premium, 
shall not be materially higher and the price received by the Company for the sale of put-options, or the 
respective option premium, shall not be materially lower than the theoretical market price of the derivatives as 
determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation methods. When determining the theoretical market 
value, the price per share stipulated in the derivatives shall be taken into consideration in an appropriate 
manner. 
Finally, the Company may agree with one or more credit institutions or other entities fulfilling the prerequisites of Section 
186 para. 5 sentence 1 AktG that these deliver to the Company, during a predefined period, a previously determined 
number of shares or a previously determined euro equivalent of shares in the Company. In such case, the price at which 
the Company purchases treasury shares must be calculated taking into account a deduction from the arithmetic mean of 
the share’s volume-weighted average price in the Xetra trading system of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or any 
equivalent successor system), calculated during a period comprising a previously determined number of exchange 
trading days. However, the share’s price may not fall short of the aforementioned mean by more than twenty percent. 
Moreover, the credit institutions or other entities fulfilling the prerequisites of Section 186 para. 5 sentence 1 AktG must 
undertake to purchase the shares to be delivered on the stock exchange at prices that are within the range that would 
apply if these shares were directly purchased on the stock exchange by the Company itself. 
The authorization may be exercised for any purpose permitted by law, in particular, to pursue one or more of the 
objectives specified below. The purchase for the purpose of trading in treasury shares is excluded. 
 
The Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to cancel the treasury 
shares purchased on the basis of this authorization pursuant to Section 71 para. 1 no. 8 AktG without adopting 
another resolution of the Company’s shareholder meeting. The cancellation may be restricted to part of the 
shares purchased. The authorization to effect cancellation may be exercised more than once. As a general rule, 
the cancellation shall result in a capital reduction. In derogation from this, the Management Board may stipulate 
that the registered share capital remain unchanged and that instead the proportion of the remaining shares in 
the registered share capital be increased as a result of the cancellation pursuant to Section 8 para. 3 AktG. In 
this case the Management Board is authorized to adjust the corresponding number in the Articles of 
Association. 
 
The Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to use the shares 
purchased on the basis of the authorization by means other than by a sale via the stock market or an offer to all 
shareholders subject to full or partial exclusion of subscription rights of the shareholders as follows: 
o 
for sale against non-cash contribution, in particular – but without limitation – to acquire companies, divisions 
of companies or equity interests in companies; 
o 
for sale against cash payment provided that this takes place at a price that is not substantially lower than 
the market price of shares of the Company at the time of the sale (simplified exclusion of subscription rights 
pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4, Section 71 para.1 no. 8 sentence 5 half-sentence 2 AktG). The 
authorization shall be limited, subject to inclusion of other shares and warrant-linked or convertible bonds 
as well as profit-sharing certificates conferring an option or conversion right or a conversion obligation 
which have been issued or sold subject to the exclusion of subscription rights of the shareholders during the 
term of this authorization until its exercise in direct or analogous application of Section 186 para. 3 
sentence 4 AktG, to a threshold of 10 % in aggregate of the current registered share capital. Decisive for 
the threshold of 10 % 1s the registered share capital figure on the date when this authorization becomes 
effective. In the event that the registered share capital figure should be lower at the time when this 
authorization is exercised, such lower value shall be decisive;

o 
to fulfil obligations of the Company arising from warrants and conversion options or the conversion 
obligations from warrant-linked or convertible bonds or profit-sharing certificates (or combinations of all 
these instruments) conferring conversion or option rights or establishing a conversion obligation which have 
been issued by the Company or by companies which are controlled by it or in which it holds a majority 
interest; 
o 
to grant to holders of warrant-linked bonds, convertible bonds or profit-sharing certificates conferring 
conversion or option rights or establishing a conversion obligation conferring conversion or option rights or 
establishing a conversion obligation (or combinations of all such instruments) issued by the Company or by 
companies which are controlled by it or in which the Company holds a majority interest, subscription rights 
in the scope to which they would be entitled after exercise of the rights or obligations under such 
instruments; 
o 
to transfer shares under a participation program or a share-based remuneration. The transfer of shares or 
respective commitments or agreements shall only be made to/with persons who participate in such program 
or receive such share-based remuneration as a member of the Management Board of the Company, a 
member of the managing body of a company dependent from the Company or an employee of the Company 
or a company dependent from the Company. A transfer of treasury shares to such persons may be made at 
reduced prices or without any separate consideration. To the extent treasury shares are to be granted to 
members of the Company’s Management Board under this authorization, the Supervisory Board of the 
Company shall decide on the allocation and all other relevant details. 
The authorizations above can be exercised once or numerous times by companies which are controlled by the Company 
or in which it holds a majority interest or by third parties for the account of the Company or companies controlled by it or 
in which it holds a majority interest. To this extent, the shareholders’ subscription rights are excluded. 
Significant agreements of the company that are subject to a change of control as a result of a takeover offer and 
the resulting effects 
RENK Group AG and its subsidiaries are parties to the following material agreements, which contain provisions for the 
event of a change of control or acquisition of control as a result of a takeover offer: 
 
There is a credit agreement (Super Senior Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement – SSRCF and 
Guarantee Facilities Agreement) dated July 9, 2020 between RENK GmbH (formerly Rebecca BidCo GmbH) as 
the borrower and a number of lenders, including COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Suisse 
(Switzerland) Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International and UniCredit Bank AG. 
The credit limit of the SSRCF and Guarantee Facilities Agreement amounts to € 50,000,000.00. The guarantee 
limit was originally € 167,500,000.00 and, as a result of multiple increases and adjustments, is now a total of € 
275,000,000.00 as of December 31, 2023. The credit agreement contains a "change of control" clause. This is 
triggered in the case of share transfers if (a) RENK FinCo GmbH (formerly Rebecca FinCo GmbH) no longer 
holds 100 % of the shares or voting rights in RENK GmbH, (b) persons other than those specified in the SSRCF 
and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, acting alone or jointly, directly or indirectly acquire more than 50 % of the 
voting rights in RENK GmbH or (c) RENK GmbH transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another person 
who is neither a subsidiary of RENK GmbH nor belongs to certain other persons named in the SSRCF and 
Guarantee Facilities Agreement. In the event of a change of control, the individual lenders can terminate their 
obligations and demand repayment of amounts disbursed by them. 
 
 
RENK GmbH has outstanding bonds (Senior Secured Notes) dated July 13, 2020 and June 30, 2021 with a total 
nominal value of € 520,000,000.00. The bonds are subject to the same change of control conditions as the 
aforementioned SSRCF and Guarantee Facilities Agreement. A change of control gives the respective bond 
holders the right to demand that RENK GmbH offers to repurchase the bonds at a purchase price of 101 % of 
the outstanding nominal amount plus interest.

 
On September 22, 2023, RENK GmbH as borrower and RENK Group AG, RENK FinCo GmbH and RENK 
GmbH as guarantors signed a further credit agreement with several lenders, including Crédit Agricole Corporate 
and Investment Bank, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Suisse 
(Switzerland) Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, J.P. Morgan SE, Landesbank Baden-
Württemberg, Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) 
Frankfurt Branch, Tokio Marine Europe S.A., branch for Germany, UniCredit Bank AG und Zurich Insurance plc 
branch for Germany (New Senior Facilities Agreement), which includes a term credit line of € 525,000,000.00, a 
revolving credit line of € 75,000,000.00 as well as a guarantee framework of € 450,000,000.00. The agreement 
contains a change of control clause in the event that (a) RENK Group AG no longer directly or indirectly holds 
100 % of the shares or voting rights in RENK FinCo GmbH or (b) one person or several persons acting jointly 
directly or indirectly gain control over RENK Group AG, i.e. holds or controls 30 % or more of the share capital 
or voting rights in RENK Group AG. In the event of a change of control, the individual lenders can terminate 
their obligations and demand repayment of amounts disbursed by them. 
Compensation agreements made by the company with members of the Management Board or employees in the 
event of a takeover offer 
RENK Group AG has not entered into any compensation agreements with its employees or with members of its 
Management Board or with employees or managing directors of direct or indirect subsidiaries in the event of a change of 
control.

Company Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l., is obliged to prepare consolidated financial statements due to its direct 100 % interest 
in RENK FinCo GmbH, which in turn has a direct 100 % interest in RENK GmbH. The RENK Group AG corporation was 
created by way of the acquisition of the shares from Volkswagen-Vermögensverwaltungs-GmbH in October 2020.  
RENK FinCo GmbH and RENK GmbH exercise the exemption option provided by section 291 of the HGB and do not 
prepare their own consolidated financial statements or group management report. In addition, the entities RENK Test 
Systems GmbH and RENK Magnet Motor GmbH applied the exemption option in accordance with section 264 para. 3 
HGB and therefore did not publish their annual financial statements or prepare notes or a management report. These 
consolidated financial statements of RENK Group AG for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2023 were 
prepared in line with Section 315e para. 3 of the German Commercial Code in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the 
European Union as per Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The consolidated 
financial statements were prepared on March 25, 2024 and were released for submission to the Supervisory Board. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro, the functional currency of RENK. Unless stated 
otherwise, all figures are in thousand of Euro (€ thousand). Minor differences in totals or percentages can occur as a 
result of the commercial rounding of amounts. In the individual tables, amounts that have been rounded to zero are 
shown as “0”. If the figure is actually zero, it is shown as “–”. 
The information provided below on the 2022 consolidated financial statements and management report relates to the 
amended consolidated financial statements and management report, which were prepared as at January 27, 2024. 
Significant events: Conversion of legal form and capital increase 
By shareholder resolution on August 9, 2023 and entry in the commercial register on August 23, 2023, the company’s 
subscribed capital was increased from € 25 thousand by € 99,975 thousand to € 100,000 thousand. This was a capital 
increase from own funds that took place prior to the conversion to a stock corporation.  
The Company’s subscribed capital of € 100,000 thousand became the share capital of the stock corporation that the 
company was converted into. The previous company shares were replaced by a total of 100,000,000 no par value 
shares, each with a notional interest in the share capital of € 1.00l. The shares are bearer shares.

The Management Board was authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, in the period ending on 
September 10, 2028, to increase the Company’s registered share capital in one or more tranches by up € 50,000,000.00 
(in words: fifty million euros) in aggregate by issuing up to 50,000,000 new no par value bearer shares against cash 
contribution or contribution in kind (“Authorized Capital”). However, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the 
consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the statutory subscription rights of the shareholders in relation to one or 
more increases of the registered share within the scope of the Authorized Capital.  
RENK repaid a € 50,000 thousand portion of a loan to Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. on August 11, 2023. Rebecca BidCo 
S.à r.l. made a voluntary contribution in the amount of the outstanding repayment claim of € 45,090 thousand by 
resolution dated September 20, 2023. This contribution was approproated to the Company’s free capital reserves in 
accordance with section 272 para. 2 no. 4 HGB.

(d) 
Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the relevant exchange rates at the time of the transaction. In 
subsequent periods, monetary assets and liabilities are measured at the using the mid-market spot rate at the reporting; 
exchange rate differences are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. On initial recognition of 
an asset, expense or income that includes prepayments received or made, the exchange rate at which the non-monetary 
items from prepayments were translated on the date of the transaction is used. 
The financial statements of entities from countries outside the Euro area are translated into Euro using the functional 
currency concept. The functional currency is determined by the primary economic environment it is the respective local 
currency of the entities consolidated. 
The financial statements are translated using the modified exchange rate method, according to which items in the 
statement of financial position - except equity - are translated using the rate at the end of the reporting period, while 
income statement items are translated using weighted average exchange rates. Equity is translated at historical rates. 
The resulting translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the subsidiary 
and presented as a separate item in equity.

3. Accounting principles 
The presentation in the statement of financial position distinguishes between current and non-current assets and 
liabilities. Assets and liabilities are classified as current if they are due within one year or within the longer operating 
cycle. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and assets and pension provisions from defined benefit plans are shown as 
non-current items. The consolidated income statement has been prepared using the cost of sales method. 
With the exception of certain items such as financial instruments at fair value and provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations, the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of amortized cost. 
The consolidated financial statements are based on the financial statements of RENK Group AG and its consolidated 
subsidiaries, which are prepared using the same corporation-wide accounting policies. 
(a) 
Revenue recognition 
The revenue recognized is generated through the sale of goods or services related to drive technology. Production 
includes both standard and customer-specific solutions. The services sold include maintenance work. Revenue is 
recognized when the services are provided or when the customer obtains control of the goods and services. 
At contract inception it is determined whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time. The performance 
obligation is recognized over a period of time if the following criterion of IFRS 15.35 is met: The assets created have no 
alternative use for RENK and RENK has an enforceable right to payment by the customer for the performance 
completed to date. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
65 
 
Revenue from performance obligations fulfilled over time is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. 
RENK determines the percentage of completion using the input-based method to estimate the costs incurred in relation 
to the expected total costs. The contract costs incurred represent the best benchmark for measuring the degree of 
fulfillment of the performance obligations. If the expected costs exceed the expected revenues, an impairment loss is 
initially recognized for assets used to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, appropriate provisions are established.  
If the requirements for satisfaction over time are not met, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time in line 
with agreed trade terms (Incoterms). 
Revenue is determined by the transaction price, which is equal to the expected consideration including possible variable 
price components. If variable consideration has been agreed in a contract, revenue is estimated using the most likely 
amount method. Variable consideration is only taken into account in the transaction price if it is highly probable that it 
will arise. For multi-component contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to the individual, distinct performance 
obligations relative to the stand-alone selling prices. 
The breakdown in accordance with IFRS 15.114 into various categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors is shown in section 7. Revenue in the notes on 
the consolidated income statement. 
Costs incurred in connection with fulfilling contracts (cost to obtain a contract) are recognized depending on how they 
arise. Costs incurred in preparing for and launching series production relate to services performed at the beginning of 
the project phase that are of a one-off nature. These pre-production costs constitute part of the performance obligation 
and are recognized alongside with the products to be delivered. 
Costs in connection with post-production development are incurred independently of the degree of completion and the 
contractual performance obligation and are therefore recognized as current expense through work in progress and the 
cost of sales. Costs in connection with the ongoing adjustment of series production processes are also recognized as 
current expense. 
In general, the performance of services by RENK provides a benefit for the customer only after completion, as the 
machines are adapted specifically for the customer and significant reworking would be required if the services were 
stopped before completion. Revenue from services is therefore recognized at a point in time. 
 
The table below shows the timing of performance for the performance obligations from contracts with customers. 
Timing of performance fulfillment per revenue type 
  
Type of revenue 
Timing of performance 
Revenue from the sale of goods 
Depending on the customer contract and the respective order, the timing of revenue 
recognition is often the same as the time of delivery. 
Revenue from the sale of customer-specific products 
Revenue is recognized over time for customer-specific products for which there is 
an enforceable right to payment for performance completed in the amount of costs 
incurred and a reasonable profit margin. This means that revenue is recognized 
before the actual time of delivery. Revenue in connection with customer-specific 
finished goods revenue is recognized at the full price of the finished goods in the 
mandatory acceptance period. For customer-specific work in progress, revenue in 
the mandatory acceptance period is not determined at the full price of a finished 
good, but based on the acquisition cost of the work in progress. The methodology 
described above is the best way of reflecting the transfer of customer-specific 
products to the customer. 
Revenue from the sale of services 
Revenue for services is recognized at a point in time upon completion. 
 
 
 
 
If a financial asset could contain a significant financing component (receivables for customer advances), in accordance with 
IFRS 15.63 the entity does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of this if it is expected at contract 
inception that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer 
pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

(b) 
Cost of sales, distribution expenses and administrative expenses 
The cost of sales item comprises product-related expenses, including research and development costs. The latter 
include costs to develop products and technologies for which the recognition criteria under IAS 38 are not met. The cost 
of sales consists of costs of the products and merchandise sold. In addition to the direct material and manufacturing 
costs, production costs also comprise production-related overheads, including depreciation of production equipment. 
Distribution expenses comprise the costs of the sales department, including staff and material costs, as well as other 
distribution expenses.  
General and administrative expenses include pro rata staff and material costs and miscellaneous other administrative 
expenses such as expenses for Group management, HR, or accounting that have not been charged to other account 
cost centers as an internal service.  
(c) 
Operating expenses 
Operating expenses are recognized at the time of change of control of the goods; expenses for advertising and sales 
promotion and other sales-related expenses are recognized at the time they are incurred.  
Warranty provisions are recognized when the products are sold. Expenses for research are immediately recognized in 
profit or loss. Interest and other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they arise. A 
qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a period of at least a year to get ready for its intended use or sale.  
(d) 
Intangible assets 
Individually acquired intangible assets are capitalized at acquisition cost and then amortized over the period of their 
finite useful life.  
For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, cost is equal to their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following periods: 
Useful life of intangible assets 
  
Type of intangible asset 
in years 
Software 
3 
Licenses and similar rights 
Contractual terms of use 
Customer relationships 
15 to 30 
Technologies 
10 to 30 
Brand 
30 
 
 
 
 
If there are indications that intangible assets could be impaired, RENK performs an impairment test and recognizes an 
impairment loss where necessary. 
There is no amortization if the useful life is indefinite. Instead, the intangible assets are tested for impairment at least 
once a year.  
Please see the information in section g) Impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.  

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
67 
 
(e) 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are capitalized at cost and then depreciated over their expected useful lives. Investment 
grants are deducted from cost. The cost of internally generated assets includes directly attributable production costs and 
pro rata production overheads. Where property, plant and equipment consist of material identifiable components with 
different useful lives, these components are recognized and depreciated separately.  
Expenses for maintenance and repairs are recognized in profit or loss, unless they must be capitalized. 
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. The useful lives 
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if necessary. 
Depreciation is essentially based on the following useful lives: 
Useful life of property, plant and equipment 
  
Type of intangible asset 
in years 
Buildings 
10 to 50 
Property facilities 
5 to 33 
Technical equipment and machinery 
5 to 21 
Other equipment, operating and office equipment 
3 to 15 
 
 
 
 
If there are indications that property, plant and equipment could be impaired, RENK performs an impairment test and 
recognizes an impairment loss where necessary. Please see the information in section g) Impairment losses on 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.  
(f) 
Leases 
Under lessee accounting, leases for property, plant and equipment are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities in the statement of financial position.  
The lease liability is recognized at the amount of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate 
over the entire term of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is used only if the interest rate implicit in the lease 
cannot be readily determined. During the term of the lease, the lease liability is carried forward using the effective 
interest method and taking lease payments into account. 
The right-of-use asset is recognized at the amount of the lease liability plus initial direct costs. In subsequent periods, 
the right-of-use asset is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the economic life of the 
underlying asset, when this is shorter.  
The right-of-use assets shown in the statement of financial position are presented in those statement of financial position 
items in which the assets to which the lease relates would have been presented if RENK had owned them. The right-of-
use assets are therefore presented under non-current assets in property, plant and equipment as of the end of the 
reporting period. 
The practical expedients applied for short-term and low-value leases mean that no right-of-use asset or lease liability is 
recognized for these leases. The lease payments for these are recognized in the income statement as an expense. Low-
value leases are leases where the new value of the leased asset does not exceed € 5,000. Leases with a total term of 
up to twelve months are classed as short term. The IFRS 16 accounting requirements are not applied to leases for 
intangible assets. 
Many leases include extension and termination options. All relevant factors and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise or not exercise the option are taken into account when determining the lease terms. Optional 
periods are taken into account when determining the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be 
exercised or not exercised. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
68 
 
To discount the lease liability, an incremental borrowing rate for RENK is used with regard to the respective currency 
and the contract term. The incremental borrowing rate is used only if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be 
readily determined. In the reporting period, the lease liabilities from new leases, contract modifications and changes in 
determining the term of the lease were discounted at a Corporation interest rate in a range between 5.44 % and 5.59 % 
(previous year: between 2.60 % and 5.55 %). If the lease is modified or there are changes in the lease payments, the 
term of the lease or the estimate with regard to exercising call options, then the lease liability is remeasured. The right-
of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying asset 
and the lease term and are adjusted for any remeasurements of the lease liability. 
(g) 
Impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
If there are indications that the carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment may be 
impaired, an impairment test is performed. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are tested for 
impairment at least annually.  
Goodwill is assigned to the cash-generating units to test it for impairment. It is assigned based on the benefit that was 
received from the business combination when the goodwill was identified. In fiscal year 2023, the goodwill resulting from 
the acquisition of RENK in 2020 and from the acquisition of RENK America in 2021, which is allocated to the cash-
generating units, was tested for impairment. Recoverability was confirmed.  
The recoverable amount of the respective asset is calculated to determine the extent of a possible impairment loss. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
The value in use is the present value of the expected cash flows determined by budgets prepared by the Executive 
Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. This planning is based on expectations regarding future development of 
the various individual markets. Appropriate assumptions about macroeconomic trends (development of currency, interest 
and commodities prices) and historical developments are taken into account. The planning period covers a three-year 
period. Please see the forecast in the Group Management Report for information on the assumptions in the detailed 
planning period. Plausible assumptions on future developments are made for subsequent years. Planning assumptions 
are adjusted to take account of current knowledge.  
The calculation of cash flows is based on expected growth rates for the markets in question. The cash flows estimate 
after the end of the planning period is based on a growth rate of 1 % p.a. 
The discount rate used (before taxes) is determined on the basis of a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in line 
with market conditions. This is based on the interest rate for risk-free investments, the market risk premium and the 
borrowing rate, as well as taking into account specific peer group information for the beta factors and the debt-to-equity 
ratio. The underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted if necessary. 
If a recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the smallest identifiable 
cash-generating unit to which the asset in question can be assigned is determined. If the recoverable amount of an 
asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss on the asset is immediately recognized in profit or loss. 
If an asset or cash-generating unit on which an impairment loss was recognized later has a higher recoverable amount, 
an impairment loss is reversed up to no higher than the amortized cost that would have resulted without the impairment. 
The impairment loss is reversed in profit or loss and is recognized in other operating income. The reversal of impairment 
losses on goodwill is not permitted.  
Please see 4.1 Financial risk management for information on impairment in connection with financial assets.  

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023

(h) 
Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes directly attributable production costs 
and pro rata fixed and variable production overheads. The allocated overheads are mostly determined on the basis of 
normal capacity utilization. Distribution expenses, general and administrative expenses and borrowing costs are not 
capitalized. Raw materials and merchandise are measured at weighted average cost. 
Impairment factors, such as obsolescence, storage damage or price changes, are taken into account by means of a 
write-down in the net realizable value. If amortized cost exceeds net realizable value, then inventories are write-off. If 
the reason for the write-off no longer applies in subsequent periods, the write-off on inventories is reversed up to their 
amortized cost. 
(i) 
Contract assets and liabilities 
When either party to a contract has satisfied its performance obligations, the entity must recognize a contract asset or a 
contract liability, depending on whether the entity has satisfied its performance obligation or the customer has paid. 
Enforcable rights to payment, which are to be recognized as receivables, must also be taken into account. 
Contract assets result from performance obligations satisfied over time and are accounted for using an input method 
based on costs incurred. Under this method, pro rata revenue and the cost of sales are presented in accordance with the 
progress achieved by the end of the reporting period. This is calculated based on the transaction price agreed with the 
customer and the expected contract costs. The percentage of completion is calculated as the proportion of the costs 
incurred by the end of the reporting period in the total expected cost of the contract.  
If the result of a performance obligation cannot be reliably determined, revenue is recognized only in the amount of the 
contract costs incurred. Under the percentage of completion method, the parts of the contract for which revenue has 
been generated are recognized under contract assets, taking account of prepayments received and prepayments 
receivable. 
Expected losses from performance of obligations over a period of time are recognized in full. In contract assets, contract 
losses are recognized on a pro rata basis; provisions are established for the remaining share of the expected contract 
losses. 
Impairment losses on contract assets are described under 4.a Financial risk management. 
Contract liabilities comprise prepayments received and the contra entry for unconditional customer prepayment 
receivables, i.e. liabilities from prepayments to be received. 
(j) 
Primary financial instruments 
Financial instruments are agreements that give rise to a financial asset at one entity while at the same time giving rise to 
a financial liability or equity instrument at another.  
RENK’s primary financial assets include Trade receivables, Financial investments, Marketable securities, Other financial 
assets, Cash and cash equivalents. Primary Financial liabilities include Financial liabilities, Trade payables and Other 
financial liabilities. 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented at their gross amount. They are only offset when this is legally enforceable 
for RENK at the current time and it actually intends to offset them. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
70 
 
Financial assets 
Primary financial assets are initially recognized in the case of a regular way purchase on the settlement date, i.e. the 
date on which the financial asset is delivered. . It is derecognized as soon as the right to receive cash and cash 
equivalents or another financial asset expires due to payment, by decree, statute of limitations, set-off or due to another 
factor or the entitlement is transferred to another person, with all risks transferred in full to the acquirer. With regard to 
the regular sale of primary financial assets, the settlement date is the date of derecognition, as is the case for 
recognition. 
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as follows based on the business model for their management and 
the structure of cash flows:  
 
measured at amortized cost (Trade receivables, Other financial assets, Cash and cash equivalent), 
 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (Financial investments), and 
 
measured at fair value through profit or loss (Derivatives and Trade receivables that can be sold under a factoring 
agreement). 
Regarding financial assets (debt instruments) for which the cash flows at specified dates are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI criterion), RENK intends to hold these to collect the associated cash flows. These financial 
assets are thus classified as measured at amortized cost.  
One exception is the sale of Trade receivables as part of a factoring agreement. RENK’s intention is to sell the Trade 
receivables for certain customers defined in the contract. These Financial assets are therefore classified as measured at 
fair value through profit or loss. As at December 31, 2023, all of these receivables have been sold.   
Equity investments are measured at fair value. RENK does not exercise the option of recognizing changes in the fair 
value of equity instruments in Other financial income and expenses. 
For financial assets, other than Trade receivables, without significant financing components, additions are measured at 
fair value on initial recognition. In the case of an asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the 
transaction costs directly attributable to its acquisition or issue are added or deducted. Trade receivables without any 
significant financing components are recognized at the transaction price under IFRS 15 on initial recognition.  
Financial assets at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest method in subsequent periods and must be 
assessed for impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss if the asset is derecognized, modified or 
becomes impaired. 
At the end of each reporting period, indications of impairment of individual financial assets are assessed. Assessing 
impairment risks is subject to uncertainty and is in some cases influenced by judgments made by management. 
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. The impairment for credit losses is measured on the basis of the  
12-month expected credit losses (stage 1) or on the basis of the expected credit losses over the entire term. The 12-
month expected credit losses result from possible default events within 12 months of the balance sheet date. If assigned 
to level 2 or 3 of the impairment model or using the simplified approach, an impairment loss is recognized at an amount 
equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Further information can be found in section 4. Risk management and financial 
instruments. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition once RENK becomes a party to the contract. In the 
case of a liability that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue are added or deducted. As all primary financial liabilities at RENK are classified as measured at 
amortized cost, they are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e. when all obligations specified in the contract have 
been met, been canceled, or expired. The financial liability is also derecognized if the contractual terms are amended 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
71 
 
and the cash flows of the modified liability differ significantly. If this is the case, a new financial liability is recognized 
based on the amended terms. If a financial liability is derecognized, any difference between the carrying amount of the 
extinguished liability and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. 
(k) 
Derivative financial instruments 
The RENK Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risks that may arise primarily from 
operating activities. RENK mainly uses currency forwards for this purpose.  
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition on the trade date and at the end of each 
subsequent reporting period. Gains and losses from measurement at fair value are recognized in profit or loss. 
The fair value for derivatives is their positive or negative market value, taking counterparty risk into account. If no quoted 
market prices are available, fair values are calculated based on the conditions at the end of the reporting period, such as 
interest rates or exchange rates, and using recognized models such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing 
models. 
An embedded derivative in a hybrid contract with a financial liability or a non-financial host contract is separated from 
the host contract and accounted for as a separate derivative if: 
 
the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host contract 
 
a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative  
 
the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 
Multiple embedded derivatives in a single hybrid contract are treated as a single compound embedded derivative unless 
they relate to different risk positions, can readily be separated, and are independent of each other.  
The assessment of whether an embedded derivative is to be separated is made only once on initial recognition of the 
hybrid contract. A reassessment is made only if a change occurs in the contractual conditions that significantly changes 
the cash flows. 
A separated derivative is measured at fair value, with corresponding changes in value recognized in the financial result 
in the consolidated income statement.  
In the context of central financial management at the RENK Corporation, the hedging transactions of the subsidiaries are 
performed by RENK GmbH and charged on to the subsidiaries. Further information on risk management at the RENK 
Corporation can be found in section 4. Risk management and financial instruments. 
(l) 
Income taxes 
Tax liabilities include current income tax liabilities. 
Current tax is the anticipated tax liability or tax asset on the taxable income or tax loss for the fiscal year, based on tax 
rates that apply or will soon apply at the end of the reporting period, as well as all adjustments of the tax liability for 
previous years. The amount of the anticipated tax liability or tax asset reflects the best estimate, taking account of any 
tax uncertainties. 
Deferred taxes are presented in separate items of the statement of financial position. Income tax liabilities for potential 
tax risks are recognized based on the best possible estimate. The likely amount of the tax arrears payment is used as a 
basis for recognized income tax items. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax 
basis, for temporary differences in profit or loss arising on consolidation and tax loss carryforwards. Tax effects from 
distributions of profit are recognized as deferred taxes only when the appropriate earnings resolution has been passed. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
72 
 
Deferred taxes are measured at the prevailing tax rate at the end of the reporting period or the future tax rate highly 
likely to be used. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that taxable profit will be available for the utilization of the 
deductible temporary differences or the tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are usually subsequently measured 
based on future taxable income for a planning period of three fiscal years. 
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same type of tax and the same taxation 
authority. 
Changes in deferred taxes in the statement of financial position lead to deferred tax expense or income. If the change in 
deferred taxes results from items recognized directly in equity, the change in deferred taxes is also recognized directly in 
equity. 
Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and 
interests in joint ventures are not recognized if the Group can determine the date of recovery and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not be recovered in the foreseeable future. 
(m) 
Pensions and similar obligations 
Pension obligations from defined benefit plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The future benefit 
obligations are measured on the basis of the benefits accrued pro rata by the end of the reporting period and discounted 
to present value. Their measurement reflects assumptions about the future development of certain parameters that 
affect the future level of benefits. 
Provisions for pension obligations are reduced by the fair value of the plan assets held to cover the pension obligations. 
If plan assets exceed obligations, the excess is only recognized in other assets if it will result in a refund from the plan or 
a reduction of future contributions. 
The service cost, which represents the benefits of active employees accumulated in accordance with the benefit plan in 
the fiscal year, is presented in functional expenses. Net interest income and expenses are calculated by multiplying the 
net asset or net liability by the discount rate and are included in interest expense. 
Remeasurements of the net asset or net liability include actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between the 
actuarial assumptions used and the actual trends, changes in actuarial assumptions and the return on plan assets, not 
including amounts included in net interest income or expenses. Remeasurements are recognized net of deferred taxes in 
other comprehensive income in equity. 
Payments for defined contribution plans are recognized in functional expenses. 
(n) 
Other provisions 
Other provisions are recognized for all identifiable risks and uncertain obligations resulting from past events that will 
probably lead to a future outflow of resources and whose amount can be reliably estimated. They are measured at the 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. The provision is carried at its net present value where 
the time value of money is material. The discount rate is based on market interest rates. 
A reimbursement of third parties anticipated in connection with a provision is recognized as a separate asset if its 
realization virtually certain. Provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information develops or 
circumstances change. If a change in an estimate results in a reduction of the obligation, the provision is reversed 
accordingly and the income is recognized in the corresponding functions or in other operating income. 
Provisions for warranties are recognized at the time, at which the relevant product is sold or the service is performed. 
Their measurement is primarily based on historical experience. Individual provisions are also recognized for known

B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
73 
 
damages. RENK holds a special-purpose real estate fund that is protected against insolvency to serve its partial 
retirement obligation. The fair value of this fund is offset against the corresponding obligation. Provision for outstanding 
incoming invoices are recognized for services performed but not yet invoiced. Provisions for anticipated losses from 
onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefit resulting from the contract is less than the unavoidable 
costs to fulfill the contract. 
(o) 
Contingent liabilities 
If the criteria for recognition of a provision are not fulfilled, but the outflow of financial resources is not remote, then 
these obligations are disclosed in the notes on the consolidated financial statements. Contingent liabilities are 
recognized if the obligations meet the recognition criteria, i.e. the outflow of resources has become probable and their 
amount can be reliably estimated. 
(p) 
Business combinations 
The acquisition method was used to account for the business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary comprises: 
 
the fair values of the assets transferred, 
 
the liabilities incurred by the former owner of the operation acquired and 
 
the equity interests issued by the Group. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed as part of the business combination are 
initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Costs related to acquisitions are recognized as an expense. 
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net asset acquired is recognized as 
goodwill.  
(q) 
Material estimates and judgments 
When preparing consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates are made to a certain extent that affect 
the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent 
assets and liabilities in the reporting period. The estimates were made on the basis of past experience and other 
relevant factors, including the assumption of going concern. All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of 
management’s knowledge and belief to provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of 
operations of the Group. Any uncertainty is reflected in valuations, although future events can still differ from these 
estimates and have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations. Estimates and 
judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
The assumptions made regarding the following matters as of the end of the reporting period are of particular 
significance: 
The recoverability of goodwill is tested on the basis of management assumptions using the discounted cash flow 
method. The calculation of the discount rate using capital market parameters and the determination of future cash flows 
are particularly important here. 
Estimates of the useful lives of depreciable assets are based on historical experience. If, in the context of the review of 
useful life, a change is made in estimates, the remaining useful life is adjusted and any impairment loss is recognized. 
Recognizing the leases in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability requires estimates on the lease term of 
the relevant lease components. It must be assessed whether it is reasonably certain that the contractually agreed 
extension, termination and call options will be exercised. The estimate for the initial recognition of the lease components 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
74 
 
determines the amount of the lease liability and thus the right-of-use asset. Changes to the estimate in subsequent 
periods result in a change to the residual values of statement of financial position items related to leases.  
Determining impairment of financial assets requires estimates of the level and probability of occurrence of future events. 
As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience. 
Pensions and similar obligations are measured using actuarial methods. These are mainly based on assumptions 
relating to discount rates, salary and pension trends and mortality. These actuarial assumptions can differ significantly 
from actual developments due to changes in market and economic conditions and therefore lead to a substantial change 
in pensions and similar obligations. The underlying assumptions are presented in section m) Pensions and similar 
obligations. 
Depending on the matter at hand, the measurement of other provisions and similar obligations is complex at times and 
requires estimates to a considerable extent. The assumptions made by management with respect to the timing and 
amount of utilization are based, among other things, on historical data, available technical data, estimates of cost trends 
and potential warranty claims, discount rates and possible recoverable amounts. Litigation and other legal proceedings 
simultaneously give rise to complex legal issues and are subject to many difficulties and uncertainties. A provision is 
recognized for this if it is likely that, in connection with these proceedings, a liability has been incurred that will probably 
lead to an outflow of resources and its amount can be reliably estimated. Assessing whether a present obligation as of 
the end of the reporting period exists as a result of a past event, and whether a future outflow is likely and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably, requires considerable judgment and significant estimates by management. Future events and 
developments as well as changes in estimates and assumptions can lead to an amended assessment at a future date. 
Additional expenses that can have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of 
RENK thus cannot be completely ruled out. Changes in contractual or actual circumstances are monitored and assessed 
as regards the potential impact on the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. Developments in these general 
conditions that deviate from assumptions and are beyond management control can cause amounts to differ from the 
original estimates.  
Individual performance obligations are accounted for over time using the percentage of completion method. In these 
cases, revenue is recognized based on progress of completion. By using this method, it is important to have a reliable 
estimation in the progress of completion. Depending on which method is used to determine the percentage of 
completion, significant estimates include contract revenue, total contract costs, the remaining costs to completion, 
contract risks and other assessments. Each operating unit estimates are continuously reviewed by Management and are 
adjusted as necessary. 
Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
promised goods or services to a customer. Estimates are necessary to determine the transaction price, especially when 
variable consideration is included. The variability relates to the amount of the claim. The single most likely amount in a 
range of possible contractual consideration amounts is selected as the most likely amount. In addition, some or all of the 
variable consideration component is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur. This assessment of probabilities and the restriction of 
variable consideration is based on management estimates. 
As the Corporation operates in several countries, it is subject to different tax laws. The expected current income taxes 
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities must be calculated for each taxable entity. This requires, among other things, 
assumptions about the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
within the respective tax type and jurisdiction. If these assumptions differ from the actual outcome of such tax 
uncertainties, this can affect tax expenses and deferred taxes. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used 
for recognized uncertain income tax positions. 
In relation to the war in Ukraine, the Middle East conflict, and climate change, the management of the RENK Group AG 
corporation has analyzed the resulting risks and effects on accounting in fiscal year 2023. In this context, the focus was 
on the recoverability of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, inventories and contract 
assets, as well as the value of receivables. In addition, opportunities and risks are continuously monitored against the 
background of "changing era", "climate change" and “supply chain problems” and taken into account with regard to their 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
75 
 
impact on forward-looking assumptions and estimates in the measurement of assets and liabilities. In the fiscal year, 
there were no material effects on the assets and liabilities or the results of operations. 
 
We do not assume that our inventories will become worthless or that their sales prices will collapse within the 
next few years due to climate-related risks. Furthermore, there are no known indications of climate-related cost 
increases in inventories that cannot be passed on to customers. 
 
No significant adjustments to business activities are planned in the short term, which is why neither climate risks 
nor changes in the useful lives of fixed assets will be reflected at RENK. 
 
The climate-related factors relevant to RENK, such as increases in the price of electricity and water, etc., are 
already taken into account in the assumptions for the impairment test of intangible assets. RENK's short-term 
economic development is largely determined by the geopolitical situation. Consequently, climate-related factors 
play only a subordinate role for RENK in the valuation of intangible and tangible assets in the short term 
 
RENK's long-term business model focuses on the defense sector, in which the personal safety of people plays a 
key role and therefore issues such as CO2 emissions, climate change, etc. are still of secondary importance. 
This is also reflected in the valuation of receivables and contractual assets. In the civil sector, which is mainly 
reflected by the SB and M&I segments, RENK focuses on sustainable and resource-conserving solutions in the 
long-term business model, which is covered in particular by the wind energy segment. This does not result in 
any substantial risks from climate change for the measurement of receivables and contractual assets or for 
sales revenue. 
(r) 
Transaction costs and related cost reimbursements 
Until December 31, 2023, RENK incurred transaction costs in connection with a planned admission of new shareholders. 
The costs incurred in connection with the planned equity offering are recognized in profit or loss as no net proceeds for 
the Company are expected. Reimbursement claims against the shareholder are also recognized in profit or loss as a 
reduction to the corresponding expenses if the shareholder is legally obliged to reimburse the costs or is the economic 
recipient of the underlying service. Reimbursement claims against the shareholder solely based on its position as a 
shareholder are recognized as a contribution directly in equity. As of December 31, 2023, RENK shows the shareholder 
contribution of the transaction costs as an increase of the capital reserve in the amount of € 1,946 thousand. See also 
section 31. Related party disclosures.  
(s) 
Restatements and covenant breaches 
RENK has issued a secured bond (Senior Secured Notes) in the amount of € 520,000 thousand. In addition, there is a 
super senior facilities agreement as at the reporting date (see also section 35. Events after the reporting date). In this 
context, certain loan conditions (covenants) must be complied with, in particular with regard to a limit for the key 
financial figure "Senior Secured Net Leverage" (secured net financial liabilities / LTM Adj. EBITDA). Furthermore, the 
assumption of further financial liabilities and the provision of collateral is restricted in this respect. If the covenants or 
other behavioral obligations are not complied with, this can be remedied or lead to extraordinary termination of the loan 
agreements. During the financial year and as at December 31, 2023, the loan conditions were generally met. 
The consolidated financial statements of RENK Group AG (formerly: RENK Holding GmbH) as of December 31, 2021 
were retrospectively amended and consequently subjected to a supplementary audit, which was completed as of 
May 25, 2023.  
Due to the supplementary audit mentioned above, the Company faced a delay in completing and publishing the 
consolidated financial statements for 2022 that resulted in a breach of contractual reporting resulting from the senior 
secured notes and senior facilities agreement of the RENK GmbH.  
Regarding the senior secured notes, this breach was conclusively remedied by the provision of the audited consolidated 
financial statements for 2022 on May 30, 2023. Regarding the senior facilities agreement, this violation was conclusively 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
76 
 
remedied by the extension of the reporting deadline requested on May 5, 2023 and granted by a majority of the financing 
banks on May 9, 2023 and the provision of the audited consolidated financial statements for 2022 on May 30, 2023 
within the extended reporting deadline. The violations did not have any economic effects on RENK GmbH. 
Due to the correction of a material misstatement in the 2021 Consolidated financial statements in connection with the 
recognition of a bond and the necessary adjustment entries in the subsequent fiscal years 2022 and 2023, these 
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 have been adjusted for the subsequent effects.

4. Risk management and financial instruments 
(a) 
Financial risk management 
RENK’s Group Treasury is responsible for operating financial risk management. The parent company’s management is 
regularly informed about the risks of the Group. 
Credit risk 
Credit risks include direct counterparty risk and the risk of deterioration in credit quality. RENK recognizes loss 
allowances for expected credit losses. RENK has three kinds of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit 
loss model: trade receivables, contract assets, and debt instruments measured at amortized cost. 
Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements set out in IFRS 9. As in the previous year, 
however, the impairment loss identified was immaterial.  
The maximum credit risk is limited to the carrying amounts of financial and contract assets presented in the statement of 
financial position.  
The approach for individual impairment is comparable to the approach for Trade receivables and contract assets 
(Simplified Approach). The impairment of Other financial assets is based on the general impairment model (General 
Approach). 
Trade receivables and contract assets 
Loss allowances on trade receivables and contract assets are recognized in accordance with the simplified approach of 
IFRS 9. Under this method, the expected credit losses over the total remaining term of trade receivables and contract 
assets are calculated on the basis of a provision matrix. Rates are graded depending on the number of days that a trade 
receivable is past due (risk classes). The loss rates are calculated separately for defaults in the different segments 
based on the following general credit risk characteristics: similar pattern of defaults in the past, clustering according to 
the specific default structure and, on this basis, formation of a portfolio in line with the provision matrix shown. The 
discount rates are based on historical loss rates and forward-looking factors. To account for forward-looking information, 
historical loss rates were adjusted using scaling factors. RENK has identified gross domestic product (GDP) in the 
customer regions in which products and services are sold as the most relevant factor affecting customers’ abilities to 
settle receivables. The historical loss rates are adjusted on a weighted basis on the basis of expected changes in this 
factor. 
An impairment is recognized on an individual basis if one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the debtor’s 
credit rating have occurred. These events include defaults, pending insolvency or concessions granted to the debtor on 
account of payment difficulties. RENK considers a financial asset to be in default if it is unlikely that the debtor will be 
able to pay its loan commitment to RENK in full without RENK having to resort to measures such as using collateral (if 
available). Given that, based on past experience and the customer structure in individual segments, receivables more 
than 90 days past due have not led to significant defaults, RENK does not consider a financial asset that is more than 90 
days past due to be in default. Likewise, based on past experience and the customer structure in individual segments, 
RENK does not assume that the default risk of a receivable increases significantly if the debtor is more than 30 days 
past due. The probability that a debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization is taken into account in the 
credit rating as an indicator of impairment. Trade receivables and contract assets are directly derecognized if there is no 
longer a sufficient expectation of recovery. For example, this is the case if the debtor is found to be insolvent. 
The following table shows expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets as of December 31, 2023:

Any collateral for trade receivables or contract assets did not have a material impact on the amount of the impairment 
losses. 
The impairment losses in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 consist of portfolio-based impairment losses and separate specific 
valuation allowances. 
Debt instruments at amortized cost 
Debt instruments measured at amortized cost include loans to related parties and other receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks and financial institutions with ratings ranging from A1/A+ to 
A3/BBB+ based on ratings from the agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The estimated valuation allowance 
on cash and cash equivalents was calculated based on expected losses within twelve months and reflects Short term 
maturities. Based on the external ratings from banks and financial institutions, the Group assumes that its cash and cash 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
79 
 
equivalents have a low default risk. 
 
Impairment losses for expected credit losses for these financial assets are determined on the basis of the general 
approach in IFRS 9. RENK uses credit ratings for contractual partners that are based on ratings by external parties 
(S&P). The credit ratings are reviewed regularly. All debt instruments measured at amortized cost are considered “low 
risk.” In the RENK Group’s view, a bond has a low default risk if its credit risk rating meets the global definition of 
“investment grade” (IFRS 7.35F(a)). RENK considers this to be the case if the rating is Baa3/BBB or higher. The 
impairment recognized in the period was thus limited to the expected credit losses within twelve months. RENK assumes 
a significant increase in the default risk if the credit risk deteriorates by two rating grades since initial recognition. For 
credit-impaired assets whose credit rating was not yet impaired when they were purchased or originated and for which 
there is objective evidence of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency proceedings, a loss allowance at an amount 
equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recognized (level 3). Accordingly, interest income on the net carrying amount 
would be calculated minus the loss allowance for level 3 assets.   
A financial asset is in default or is credit-impaired if one of the following criteria is met: 
 
Insolvency or a similar event indicating significant financial difficulty and a probable default of the counterparty 
 
Probable write-off 
 
Breach of contract meaning that it can be assumed with high probability that one or more receivables will not be collectible  
 
Other reasons why, in the opinion of Credit Management, it can be assumed with high probability that the receivable will not 
be collectible 
In the case of proven uncollectibility, the financial asset is derecognized. If its credit rating improves, the impairment loss 
is reversed. 
The calculation did not result in any material impairment losses.  
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk describes the risk that RENK may be unable to adequately meet its payment obligations or can raise 
liquidity only at a higher price. 
Solvency and the provision of liquidity are regularly monitored on the basis of rolling liquidity planning. Financing 
requirements are covered by both operating cash flow and external financing.  
Cash management for the operating units is carried out centrally as part of cash pooling (for details, please see section 
23. Financial liabilities in the notes on the consolidated statement of financial position). Cash is combined on a daily 
basis. Thus, liquidity surpluses and requirements can be managed as necessary. For external financing, the 
opportunities on the financial markets are tracked continuously to ensure financial flexibility and to limit refinancing risks.  
In the context of a syndicated loan agreement, there are cash credit lines with banks of € 50,000 thousand for the 
entities with a term to January 13, 2025 and an extension option. Deutsche Bank acts as the lead agent for the 
syndicated loan. The basic interest rate is determined depending on the debt-to-equity ratio. The credit lines had not 
been utilized at the end of the reporting period.  
In the context of a syndicated loan agreement, RENK also has guarantee credit lines with a term to January 13, 2025 
and an extension option. The amount of the syndicated guarantee credit lines is unchanged year-on-year at 
€ 245,000 thousand and has been utilized in the amount of € 162,394 thousand (previous year: € 154,464 thousand). 
Outside the syndicated loan agreement, there are additional guarantee credit lines on a bilateral basis of 
€ 52,261 thousand (previous year: € 28,690 thousand), which amounted to € 26,213 thousand (previous year: 
€ 12,061 thousand) as at the balance sheet date. Cash collateral of € 6,431 thousand (previous year: € 7,845 thousand) 
was provided for the bilateral guarantee credit lines as of the reporting date.  
As of December 31, 2023, there is also a bond with a nominal value of € 520,000 thousand that will mature in 2025. The 
bond is listed on the TISE in Guernsey, bears interest of 5.75 % p.a. and is collateralized by pledging bank accounts,

receivables and equity investments of the guarantors. Please refer to section 35. Events after the reporting date and the 
refinancing outlined there. 
Cash and cash equivalents are essentially used to finance working capital and short-term obligations. 
There were no significant risk concentrations in the past fiscal year. 
The following table shows how the cash flows of liabilities and derivative financial instruments affect RENK's liquidity 
situation. In addition, there is a loan commitment from Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. in the amount of € 2,000 thousand, which 
can be utilized by the borrower at any time. Of this amount, € 319 thousand (previous year: € 319 thousand) had been 
drawn as at December 31, 2023. These are recognized as loan receivables:

1) The procedure for calculating the amounts was as follows: 
– If the maturity date is not fixed, the liability is assigned to the earliest maturity date. 
– Interest payments for floating rate interest are taken into account in line with the conditions as of the end of the reporting period. 
– It is assumed that the cash outflows will not occur earlier than shown.   
2) This includes the two tranches of € 320,000 thousand and € 200,000 thousand within the bond. 
Foreign currency risk 
RENK operates internationally and is thus exposed to foreign currency risks. These arise when recognized assets and 
liabilities and future transactions are denominated in a currency other than the parent company’s functional currency.  
The majority of operating activities are conducted in the functional currency. Currency risks of the remaining transactions 
are quantified by the Group entities on an ongoing basis. Taking account of predetermined risk limits by Group Treasury, 
this remaining risk is hedged decentrally at banks using currency forwards. Hedging is carried out with due regard for 
banks’ risk management requirements and is subject to stringent monitoring, which is guaranteed in particular by a strict 
separation of functions on the basis of the dual control principle. The option under IFRS 9 regarding hedge accounting in 
accordance with IFRS 9 was not exercised for this economic hedge. 
At RENK, all firm customer contracts in foreign currency with a value equivalent to more than € 250 thousand are 
hedged. Foreign currency risks related to purchasing are not hedged. 
As of the end of the reporting period, RENK’s foreign exchange risk is primarily from transactions in USD, CHF, CNY, 
CAD and GBP. Thanks to the currency forwards in place for these currencies, RENK was not exposed to any significant 
risks. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the derivative financial instruments in place at the end of the reporting period were measured in 
a hypothetical scenario. The effects of a 10 % appreciation/depreciation of a base currency in relation to the quote 
currency as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows:

Interest rate risk 
Fixed interest rates were agreed for all of RENK’s financial liabilities as of December 31, 2023 (see also section 
35. Events after the reporting period). Furthermore, RENK had no significant credit instruments that were subject to a 
floating interest rate. However, the fair value of the prepayment option embedded in the bond is influenced by changes 
in the market interest rate. As this embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss, RENK’s other 
financial result would be influenced by interest rate changes. A hypothetical increase (decrease) of 100 basis points in 
the market interest rate would have an impact on the other financial result of € ‑3,063 thousand (€ 8,550 thousand).  
(b) 
Financial instruments: Classification and fair value 
Financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value or for which a fair value is disclosed in the notes on the annual 
financial statements are to be classified in the fair value hierarchy described below. They are allocated to levels of the 
fair value hierarchy on the basis of inputs used for measurement: 
Level 1: 
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2:  
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for an asset or liability either directly (as a 
price) or indirectly (derived from prices). The fair values of level 2 financial instruments are calculated based on the 
conditions at the end of the reporting period, such as interest rates or exchange rates, and using recognized models 
such as the discounted cash flow models or option pricing model. 
Level 3:  
Input data used for the measurement of the asset or liability not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
The fair values were calculated based on the market conditions at the end of the reporting period and the measurement 
methods described. They are the prices that an independent party would pay for the assets/liabilities.

2)The values reported in the category “Not assigned to an IFRS 9 measurement category” have been adjusted. 
RENK GmbH has measured the investment in Modest Tree Media Inc., Halifax, Canada, at fair value through profit or 
loss and designated the investment in RENK U.A.E. LLC as measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income. RENK U.A.E. LLC was designated as such in order to avoid fluctuations in earnings from the measurement of 
the investment. In the 2023 financial year, a dividend payment of € 435 thousand (previous year: € 0) was made from 
the investment in RENK U.A.E. LLC for the 2022 financial year. There were no reclassifications of cumulative gains or 
losses within equity.

The equity investments are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value is calculated using the 
discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Expected future cash flows, which are determined on the basis of planning figures, 
are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for equity and debt. The sum of the discounted 
expected future cash flows reflects the enterprise value less (net) financial debt. The WACC is calculated using the 
average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt. This is then weighted with the share of total capital. The sum of the 
discounted expected future cash flows reflects the enterprise value less the (net) financial liabilities in order to determine 
the equity value. 
A change in the average cost of capital or the expected cash flows would have the following effects on equity or the 
financial result:

When calculating the sensitivities shown above, one parameter is changed in each case while leaving the other 
parameters unchanged. In principle, a market change that affects one input may also correlate with other input data. 
These effects may intensify the changes or cancel each other out, depending on the respective movements. The model 
is based on the implicit assumption that the correlation remains constant over time. The fair values within level 3 
developed as follows:

All other current financial assets and other current and non-current financial liabilities measured at fair value through 
profit or loss are currency derivatives (currency forwards). To measure fair value, future cash flows are calculated by 
discounting the forward cash flows based on foreign exchange spot spot and swap rates (using the difference in interest 
method). Accordingly, they are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
In case of current financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts as of the end of the 
reporting period approximately match their fair value due to the maturities. 
Other non-current financial assets measured at amortized cost mainly include loans to affiliated companies. To measure 
the fair values, the future contractually agreed cash flows are discounted using a term-adequate, credit-risk-adjusted 
market interest rate.

The fair value of the separated embedded derivative is deducted from the listed price of the bond. The bond’s fair value 
is therefore allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
In addition, the compound embedded derivative is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value is 
calculated using a trinomial tree approach based on the Hull-White single-factor model. The model uses the following 
inputs that are observable on the market: the market price of the bond, the market interest rate, implicit market volatility 
of interest rate swaptions and credit derivatives (CDS options); as well as the following unobservable inputs: the 
estimated probability of a change of control occurring. 
The volatility of the underlying Hull-White process is calibrated using the weighted average volatility of interest rate 
swaptions and credit derivatives, while the level of the required market interest rate is calibrated to the bond price. The 
Hull-White process models the development of the required interest rate over time, and exercising the options is 
reviewed using the trinominal tree approach. The model uses a stochastic process to develop RENK’s market interest 
rate curve. The volatility of the process is calibrated to the volatilities of the CDS options and swaptions (weighted 
average). The credit spread compared to the risk-free interest rate is calibrated to adjust the bond price in the model to 
the market price of the bond. At each time step in the trinomial tree, the possible development of the interest rate 
required by the market is modeled. For each node, a check is performed based on the timing and the development of the 
interest rate in the model to determine whether it is advantageous to exercise the option or to continue the option. The 
corresponding value of the option is traced back through the tree to the measurement date.

remains constant over time. The fair values within level 3 developed as follows:

The fair value of the loan liabilities from fiscal year 2022 is calculated by discounting the cash flows with a risk-adjusted 
interest rate curve. The risk adjustment is calculated based on the relationship between the interest rate in question and 
the performance of the bond from the acquisition of the RENK Group and RENK America. It is thus allocated to level 2 of 
the fair value hierarchy. 
There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the fiscal year.

Financial instruments: Offsetting 
The following table contains information on possible offsetting effects on the consolidated statement of financial position 
and the financial impact of offsetting in the case of instruments which are subject to a legally enforceable master 
offsetting agreement or similar agreement. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements

Generally, the amounts owed by each counterparty under the derivative transactions on a single day in relation to all 
outstanding transactions in the same currency are combined into a single net amount that is to be paid by one party to 
the other (e.g. German Framework Agreement on the Conclusion of Financial Futures, or Master Netting Agreements of 
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)). In certain cases – for example, if a credit event such as 
default occurs – all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the value on termination is calculated, 
and only a single net amount is to be paid to settle all transactions. 
The “Related financial instruments that are not offset” column shows the amounts that are subject to a master offsetting 
agreement, but that cannot be offset because the conditions have not been met. Offsetting can only occur given certain 
future events, such as the insolvency of one of the parties.

5. Statement of cash flows 
In the statement of cash flows, cash flows are divided into cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing 
activities and cash flows from financing activities. The effects of changes in the scope of consolidation and exchange 
rates are eliminated in the respective positions. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is 
presented separately.  
Cash flows from operating activities are calculated using the indirect method. Non-cash operating expenses and 
gains/losses from asset disposals are therefore eliminated in cash flows from operating activities. 
Besides additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and the acquisitions of subsidiaries, cash flows 
from investing activities also include cash flows from loans receivable and restricted cash as well as short term 
investments. Proceeds from these items as well as interest and dividends received are offset against each other. 
Cash flows from financing activities consist of the following cash transactions: equity contributions, lease payments, 
borrowing and repayment of financial liabilities and interest payments. 
Cash and cash equivalents shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows correspond to the “Cash and cash 
equivalents” item in the consolidated statement of financial position and to cash in hand and bank balances. 
6. New and revised accounting pronouncements and methods 
(a) 
Impact of new and revised IFRSs 
RENK has implemented all accounting standards endorsed by the EU effective from January 1, 2023 and relevant to 
RENK. The application of the new accounting standards did not have any material effects on the consolidated financial 
statements. 
In December 2021, the OECD published model rules for a new global framework for effective minimum taxation to 
ensure that the profits of multinational groups with a total annual turnover of at least € 750 million are taxed at a 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
88 
 
minimum rate of 15 % per country. The EU unanimously agreed in December 2022 to implement this framework in the 
form of a directive, which will also apply to purely domestic entities with a certain minimum turnover. The EU directive 
was transposed into the national law of the member states by December 31, 2023, so that it applies to fiscal years 
beginning after that date.  
For the RENK Group AG corporation, the new legal framework is expected to apply from fiscal year 2024. RENK Group 
AG is therefore currently examining the potential future impact of the regulations on the Group, including the effects on 
current and deferred taxes and tax payments. Additionally, internal processes are set up in a way that RENK is able to 
be fully compliant with legal requirements from fiscal year 2024 onwards. 
RENK has already applied the International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12), published in 
May 2023 and adopted into European law by the European Union in November 2023. The amendments provide for a 
temporary exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes for the top-up tax, provided it takes effect, and require new 
disclosures on the risks of global minimum taxation. 
The exemption applies retrospectively. However, as global minimum taxation had not been enacted (or substantively 
enacted) in any country in which the RENK operates as of December 31, 2022, and no related deferred tax was 
recognized at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on RENK’s consolidated financial statements.

25 % of revenue was recognized over time in fiscal year 2023 (€ 234,813 thousand, previous year: 26 %, 
€ 219,286 thousand). 
Revenue of the reporting period, which was included in the opening balance of contract liabilities as of January 1, 2023, 
amounts to € 10,762 thousand (2022: € 10,543 thousand). 
Until December 31, 2023, revenue of € 690,687 thousand (previous year: € 629,681 thousand) was recognized at a point 
in time.  
The revenue recognized over time is attributable to the following segments: € 187,392 thousand (previous year: 
€ 219,286 thousand) (VMS), € 50,803 thousand (previous year: € 0 thousand) (M&I) and € 961 thousand (previous year: 
€ 0 thousand) (SB). The revenues recognized at a point in time amount to € 341,037 thousand (previous year: 
€ 266,291 thousand) (VMS), € 245,492 thousand (previous year: € 276,059 thousand) (M&I) and € 109,902 thousand 
(previous year: € 90,889 thousand) (SB). An analysis of the contracts against the background of the alternative benefits 
of the products and the specific contractual clauses was carried out on a project basis in the M&I and VMS segments 
and led to the recognition of revenue over time in the 2023 financial year. 
Revenue of € 925,500 thousand until December 31, 2023 (€ 848,967 thousand until December 31, 2022) can be 
allocated to the following countries with a share of more than 10 % of total revenue: Germany € 246,220 thousand 
(previous year: € 188,565 thousand) and the USA € 195,896 thousand (previous year: € 231,155 thousand).  
No single customer accounted for more than 10 % of RENK’s revenues in any of the periods presented.  
The segment reporting shows how revenue breaks down by individual segment. 
Contracts with customers resulted in the following contract balances:

The combined tax rate for the German tax group is 31.95 % on profit before tax for the 2023 assessment period 
(previous year: 32.04 %). This tax rate takes into account German municipal trade tax of 16.13 % (previous year: 
16.21 %) as well as the German corporate income tax of 15.00 % and the solidarity surcharge of 5.50 % of corporate 
income tax (both unchanged year-on-year). The change in the tax rate is associated with the change in domestic 
assessment rates and with new domestic entities at various locations. 
In contrast to the presentation in the previous year, a weighted Group tax rate determined on the basis of the earnings 
amounts and tax rates of the individual Group companies was no longer used to calculate the expected tax expense in 
the tax reconciliation in the 2023 financial year; instead, the tax rate of 31.95 % determined for RENK for the German 
income tax group is now used. 
This change in method was made in order to achieve greater consistency in the information useful to the users of the 
financial statements. The previous method of using the weighted Group tax rate regularly results in major fluctuations 
between successive financial years, for example due to special effects or the volatile earnings situation of individual 
Group companies. The use of the nominal tax rate of the German tax group smoothes out these fluctuations and makes 
the respective reported value of the expected tax expense more comparable to the corresponding previous year's value. 
An adjustment for the previous year's comparison column would be immaterial and has therefore not been made. 
The presentation of the corresponding previous year's figures for 2022 remains unchanged from the presentation in the 
consolidated financial statements due to the lack of material effects on net assets and the income statement, meaning 
that the expected tax expense in the previous year's column continues to be calculated using the weighted Group tax 
rate for the 2022 financial year (30.00 %).   
Local tax rates for foreign entities range from 20.79 % to 26.50 % (previous year: from 20.12 % to 25.64 %).

The effects from the change in the tax rate are mainly based on differences between the tax rate for the RENK Group 
and the national tax rate for expected taxes and on the effect of deviations from the average deferred tax rate, 
particularly at RENK America LLC. 
Non-deductible expenses are particularly related to trade tax additions.

No deferred taxes were recognized for taxable temporary difference from retained profits in connection with interests in 
affiliated entities (outside basis differences) of € 13,922 thousand (previous year: € 10,534 thousand) as no reversal of 
these differences is expected in the foreseeable future. 
IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of recognition and measurement requirements under IAS 12 if there is uncertainty as to 
the income tax treatment. Estimates and assumptions are to be made with regard to recognition and measurement, for 
example whether an assessment is made separately or together with other uncertainties, whether a probable or 
anticipated value is used for the uncertainty and whether changes have occurred in comparison to the previous period. 
The discovery risk is insignificant with regard to accounting for uncertain items in the statement of financial position. 
Accounting assumes that the tax authorities will examine the matter in question and have access to all relevant 
information. 
This does not result in any significant impact on RENK’s consolidated financial statements. 
Global minimum taxation 
The ultimate parent company of RENK is domiciled in Germany, which has implemented new legislation on global 
minimum taxation effective for fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023. RENK is in the process of taking the 
necessary internal measures to fully comply with the new legislation. In order to make an indicative assessment of the 
material impact that would have arisen if the Global Minimum Tax had already come into force in 2023, RENK has tested 
the CbCR-Safe-Harbor transitional arrangements provided for in the legislation on the basis of RENK's financial and tax 
data for 2022. On this basis, all countries in which RENK operates have been exempt from the supplementary tax. There 
is currently no evidence that this event would change on the basis of RENK's financial and tax data for 2023. 
As the new legislation in Germany did not come into force until January 1, 2024, there is no impact on current taxes for 
the year ending December 31, 2023. The RENK Group has taken advantage of a temporary mandatory exemption from 
recognizing deferred taxes for the effects of the supplementary tax and will actually recognize it as tax when it arises.

Notes on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
13. Business combination 
With effect from January 1, 2023, the following affiliated companies (previously not consolidated due to immateriality) 
were incorporated in the scope of consolidation to include them in the internal and external reporting structure: 
 
COFICAL RENK MANCAIS DO BRASIL LTDA, Guaramirim, Brazil 
 
RENK Gears Private Ltd., Bangalore, India 
 
RENK Shanghai Service and Commercial Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China  
The effect of € 469 thousand resulting from the initial consolidation of the above-mentioned companies was offset 
against equity. 
RENK acquired 100 % of shares in General Kinetics Group (“GK”) with effect from January 27, 2023. As of the 
acquisition date, GK comprised four companies: 
 
GK Holdco Inc., Brampton, Canada (“GK Holdco”) 
 
General Kinetics Engineering Corporation, Brampton, Canada (“GKEC”) 
 
General Kinetics Inc., Bedford, USA (“GK Inc.”) 
 
General Kinetics LLC, Bedford, USA (“GK LLC”) 
On the acquisition date, GK Holdco Inc., Brampton, Canada, was merged with General Kinetics Engineering 
Corporation, Brampton, Canada, following the acquisition of GK. This was followed by a merger of the company created 
by the first merger with the company Horstman Systems Inc, Woodbridge, Canada, which was already fully consolidated. 
The resulting legal entity has been trading as Horstman Canada Inc., Brampton, Canada, since May 1, 2023. With effect 
from July 18, 2023, the companies General Kinetics Inc., Bedford, USA, and General Kinetics LLC, Bedford, USA, were 
merged with Horstman Inc, Sterling Heights, USA, which was already fully consolidated.  
General Kinetics is a leading provider of chassis systems for military wheeled vehicles. This new addition will allow 
RENK to provide global mobility solutions for wheeled and tracked vehicles in the future. 
Horstman Canada Inc. was included in the consolidated financial statements of RENK Group AG from the acquisition 
date January 27, 2023 onward.  
General Kinetics (GK) was acquired at a purchase price of € ‑34,530 thousand. The purchase price was fully settled in 
cash and cash equivalents.  
As at July 31, 2023, the final fair values of the assets and liabilities at the acquisition date were determined based on 
external valuations. At the acquisition date, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from General 
Kinetics are broken down as follows:

The goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation is attributable to the expertise of the workforce and to future 
sales potential within the Horstman Group. This goodwill was fully allocated to the VMS segment and is not tax-
deductible overall. The trade receivables of € 3,601 thousand represents gross amounts. They were classified as fully 
collectible as of the acquisition date. 
In the period from February to December 2023, the newly acquired company, which is now part of Horstman Canada Inc, 
contributed € 23,313 thousand to the Group’s revenue and € 3,167 thousand to its profit after tax. If the transaction had 
taken place on January 1, 2023, additional revenue of € 1,658 thousand and additional profit after tax of € 85 thousand 
would have been considered. In 2022 and 2023, the Group incurred costs of € 875 thousand in connection with the 
business combination. These costs are fully recognized in other operating expenses in the respective period. 
The depreciation and amortization and the deferred taxes on the results of the purchase price allocation would lead to a 
negative effect of approximately € 150 thousand per month.

Other intangible assets include values for brands, customer relationships and other intangible assets from the business 
combinations in previous fiscal years. Amortization of intangible assets is included in the cost of sales. 
At RENK, the carrying amount of goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing at the level of the group of cash-
generating units to which it is allocated.  
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the VMS and SB segments (formerly: divisions). 
Impairment testing is performed at the level of these groups of cash-generating units. 
The goodwill resulting from the acquisition of RENK in 2020 was originally allocated to the VMS (71 %) and SB (29 %) 
businesses.  
The remaining goodwill of € 52,647 thousand from the business combination with RENK America and RENK Magnet-
Motor in fiscal year 2021 was fully allocated to the VMS segment. Please refer to 3.4 Intangible assets in the accounting 
principles.  
The reorganization completed in fiscal year 2023 (three segments: VMS, M&I and SB) will lead to a partial reallocation of 
goodwill. There are no changes for the SB segment, as its content is analogous to that of the former SB division. The 
content of the VMS segment has changed slightly compared to the VMS division, as the former Test Systems division 
has been integrated in this segment. As such, the new segment structure corresponds to the structure in place until 
2021 again. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition of RENK in 2020 is once again allocated to the segments in line 
with its original allocation to the business areas at that time.

With regard to price and cost increases, development is assumed to be in line with general inflation levels. 
The recoverable amount of the respective segments is determined by calculating the value in use. The value in use of 
the cash-generating groups or cash-generating units exceeded the allocated net assets in each case. The calculation is 
based on cash flow forecasts for the next three years and a subsequent perpetual annuity. The following table shows the 
key assumptions underlying the calculation of the values in use in both segments:

1)The former Test Systems division was allocated to the VMS segment as a result of the reorganization in 2023. The goodwill allocated to the former Test Systems division in 
2022 amounted to € 4,016 thousand.    
With regard to price and cost increases, development is assumed to be in line with general inflation levels. 
In determining the pretax discount rate (weighted average cost of capital (WACC)), the cost of equity and debt was 
based on a segment-specific peer group. These entities have similar business and product portfolios and thus comprise 
the most important national and international competitors. The weighting of the cost of equity and debt was based per 
cash-generating unit on the peer group’s average debt/equity ratios. Risk-free discount rates ranging from 2.5 % to  
4.5 % (previous year: from 1.5 % to 3.5 %) were applied depending on the country. 
The cash flow forecasts, which are based on approved planning by the Supervisory Board, included specific estimates 
for three years and a perpetual growth rate thereafter. The sustainable growth rate was calculated based on an estimate 
by management. The key factors driving cash flows in the planning phase are rising sales in virtually all segments, 
driven in particular by higher demand in key product groups. 
Separately from the current and assumed economic situation, like in the previous year a sensitivity analysis was 
performed with regard to the recoverability of goodwill in the segments. The effects of the following scenarios were 
examined: 
 
Increase in the discount rate by 2.5 % 
 
Decrease in the growth rate in the perpetuity to 0 % 
 
25 % reduction in the cash flow used in the terminal value. 
The sensitivity analyses showed that under these assumptions, too, there is currently no need to recognize an 
impairment of goodwill in any segment. The same applies to previous year´s CGU structure.

(a) 
Pension plans in Germany 
As one of the essential elements of its remuneration policy, RENK provides its domestic employees with benefits under 
an occupational pension system for the time after their active working life. This provides reliable additional income on 
retirement and risk protection for disability and death. 
Under the current pension plans, the active employees receive employer contributions linked to their remuneration and, 
in addition, also have the option of personal provision through deferred compensation (paid for by the employer for 
employees subject to collective bargaining agreements). When actively working, employees accrue pension capital from 
employer- and employee-financed contributions and returns from investment on the capital market. On retirement this 
pension capital is paid out as a lump sum or in installments, or in certain cases can be converted into an annuity. 
Employees' investment risks are gradually reduced with increasing age (lifecycle concept). The performance of the 
pension capital is derived from the return on the investments. As required by law, at least the total contributions paid for 
the employee will be paid out on retirement. 
Former employees, including pensioners and employees who have left the plan with vested benefits, have pension 
commitments from closed pension funds, which are predominantly geared towards providing lifetime annuity payments. 
These commitments entail the usual longevity and inflation risks, which are regularly monitored and evaluated. 
RENK Pension Trust e.V./WTW Pensionsfonds AG manages RENK’s German pension assets. These assets are 
irrevocably unavailable to the RENK entities and must be used exclusively to fund current pension payments or for 
employee claims in the event of insolvency. The proper management and use of trust assets is monitored by 
independent trustees. WTW Pensionsfonds AG is also subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin).  
The pension assets are invested by professional investment managers according to investment guidelines set by an 
Investment Committee. The strategic allocation of plan assets is based on asset liability management studies conducted 
at regular intervals. 
(b) 
Pension plans outside Germany 
In Switzerland, the defined benefit pension claims and the actuarial reserves are managed in industry-wide company 
pension institutions. Employees accrue pension capital with these institutions, which is then converted into a lifelong 
pension under the conditions prevailing at the time. The pension institutions are managed conservatively based on 
government regulations. If the claims are no longer covered by capital due to negative market developments, 
restructuring contributions can be levied from the affiliated employers and their employees. 
(c) 
Funding status 
The calculation of the present value of defined benefit obligations is based on the following assumptions:

The biometric data are based on current mortality tables for each specific country. For Germany, the Heubeck 2005 G 
mortality tables were adjusted in line with empirical data specific to RENK and therefore better reflect mortality than the 
current RT2018 G mortality tables. The BVG 2020 GT mortality tables were used for Switzerland.

Discount rates are based on the yields on corporate bonds with high credit ratings, with a maturity and currency 
matching the respective obligations. Pension and salary trends either correspond to contractual adjustments or are 
based on those found in the general regulations applicable. Salary trends comprise expected wage and salary increases 
that also consider increases resulting from career development.

The sensitivity analyses shown each consider the change in one assumption with the other assumptions unchanged 
from the original calculation, i.e. possible correlation effects between the individual assumptions are not considered. 
To analyze the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to a change in the assumed life expectancy, the age of 
beneficiaries was increased by one year as part of a comparative calculation. 
The weighted average term to maturity (Macaulay duration) of the defined benefit obligations is eight years. 
The defined benefit obligation is divided among the members of the plan as follows:

On July 13, 2020, a bond with a nominal value of € 320,000 thousand was issued. To finance the acquisition of RENK 
America in 2021, the existing bond from 2020 was increased by € 200,000 million on June 30, 2021. No changes were 
made to the term of five years or the coupon of 5.75 % p.a. The bond consists of several early repayment options that 
can be exercised at the discretion of the issuer or the bondholder. The early repayment options were identified as a 
single compound embedded derivative instrument that has been separated from the host contract as it is not closely 
related to the host contract. 
The bond is listed on TISE in Guernsey as at December 31, 2023 and is secured by pledging bank accounts, receivables 
and shares of the guarantors. The bond was recognized net of transaction costs. Interest is recognized as a liability 
under financial liabilities and paid twice a year. The financial liabilities from loans are not collateralized.  
The loan liabilities to Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. were repaid in the amount of € 50,000 thousand on August 11, 2023. By 
way of resolution on September 20, 2023, Rebecca BidCo S.à r.l. made a voluntary contribution to the capital reserves 
in the amount of the outstanding repayment amount of € 45,090 thousand (for further details, see section 20. Equity in 
the notes on the consolidated statement of financial position). 
The liabilities from cash pooling of € 2,598 thousand are owed to Schelde Gears B.V. 
For information on maturities, please refer to section 4. Risk management and financial instruments in the principles of

Other Disclosures 
26. Segment reporting 
In accordance with the management approach in IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the operating segments were identified 
based on the internal reporting and the assessment of business performance by the chief operating decision maker 
(CODM). The management is the chief operating decision maker. Taking account of this approach, the following three 
operating segments have been identified based on the product or market/customer logic: 
With its range of products and services in the Vehicle Mobility Solutions (VMS) segment, RENK is one of the global 
innovation and technology leaders for vehicle transmissions in military tracked vehicles such as main battle tanks and 
infantry tracked vehicles. In addition to transmissions for military vehicles, the product portfolio in this segment includes 
engines, suspensions, electric drives, power packs for military vehicles and test systems. Through the VMS segment, 
RENK supplies parts for more than 80 types of tracked and wheeled military vehicles to over 70 armed forces worldwide, 
with a strong focus on the European Union (EU), member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ("NATO"), 
NATO-equivalent countries and other countries such as South Korea, India and Israel. It comprises the corresponding 
activities mainly at the Augsburg site of RENK Group AG, RENK America in Muskegon (USA), the French subsidiary 
RENK France S.A.S., RENK Test System GmbH (RTS) in Augsburg and its American sales company RENK Systems 
Corporation, as well as the Horstman Group with the companies Horstman Holdings Limited and Horstman Defence 
Systems Limited in Bath (UK), Horstman Inc. in Sterling Heights (MI) (USA) and Horstman Canada in Brampton 
(Canada). 
The Marine & Industry (M&I) segment offers technology-leading propulsion and coupling solutions for commercial 
shipping and industrial applications as well as for the navy. In the marine sector, RENK's products are used in particular 
in naval surface vessels, such as frigates and destroyers, for naval and government customers, as well as in fast ferries, 
freighters and superyachts for civilian customers. RENK's marine gear units for naval vessels are used by more than 40 
of the world's navies and coast guards. In the industrial sector, RENK's customers include companies in the plastics, 
steel and cement production sectors, as well as companies in the oil and gas, hydrogen, CO2 capture and utilization,

B. Consolidated Financial Statements
 
115 
 
industrial heat pump and power generation industries. The M&I segment serves markets around the world, particularly 
those in the important markets of Germany, the United States of America, South America and the Middle East as well as 
China, where RENK has business relationships with customers from various industrial markets. RENK's global network 
of sales and service centers enables RENK to quickly support customers around the world. RENK's customized 
solutions allow it to provide customers with products that meet their specific requirements. 
The Slide Bearings (SB) segment is the global market leader in the field of standardized slide bearings (e-slide 
bearings). RENK offers slide bearings for various industrial applications of large electric drives, such as for the power 
generation sector (for conventional power generation as well as for hydroelectric, wind and nuclear power generation), 
for other industrial applications and for the marine and civil shipping sectors. The plain bearings are used, for example, 
in electric motors, generators, pumps, blowers, water turbines and conveyor belts. In addition, the SB segment offers 
innovative products such as complex special plain bearings. RENK has assembly and maintenance, repair and operating 
centers in several regions as well as a global network of representatives. 
The consolidation between the business areas is shown separately. 
The financial performance indicator of the segments and therefore the key performance indicator is an adjusted EBIT 
(operating profit before the effects from purchase price allocations and adjusted for certain items which management 
considers to be exceptional or non-recurring). Until April 2023, RENK’s key performance indicator was reported EBIT 
before purchase price allocation (PPA) (rEBITA). Due to the change in management (CFO Christian Schulz started at 
RENK in June 2023) and with the progress of the IPO, RENK implemented the new steering key performance indicator 
adjusted EBIT for management reporting purposes. Significant deviations between rEBITA and adjusted EBIT cannot be 
derived at segment level as the PPA effects and most adjustments are classified as "Others" and therefore have no 
material impact on the segments.  
The operating segments are also deemed as the reportable segments of RENK Group. As RENK began applying IFRS 8 
Segment Reporting for the first time in fiscal year 2023, the segment data as of December 31, 2022 is presented in the 
segment structure applicable since January 1, 2023 for comparative purposes. The Test Systems division has been part 
of the VMS Segment since January 1, 2023. In connection with the further centralization of functions within RENK, the 
Group started to allocate costs for central functions to its segments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to reflect an 
appropriate cost structure in its segments.

In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board of RENK Group AG, which was formed in the course of the change of 
legal form to a stock corporation, are responsible for monitoring the company's activities and are therefore considered as 
key management personnel. The members of the Supervisory Board, which has been in place since September, are 
remunerated within the scope of the base salary and attendance fees. The employee representatives on the Supervisory 
Board employed by RENK also receive their standard market remuneration. For information on Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board remuneration, please refer to sections 33. Executive Board remuneration and 34. Supervisory Board 
remuneration. 
In the previous year, remuneration for key management personnel amounted to € 3,438 thousand, consisting of     
€ 3,409 thousand from short-term benefits and € 29 thousand from other long-term benefits. 
Key management personnel remuneration for fiscal year 2023 is broken down below:

Key management personnel receive a short-term bonus in addition to their regular salary, which is mainly determined on 
the basis of earnings and cash flow. Pension commitments were also issued, for which a liability of € 313 thousand was 
recognized as of the reporting date, which was expensed in fiscal year 2023. For a description of pensions, please see 
section 21. Pensions and similar obligations in the notes on the consolidated statement of financial position. A liability of 
€ 416 thousand was recognized for the short-term cash bonus. 
Other long-term benefits comprise vacation accruals that are not settled in full within twelve months after the end of the 
period in which the related service was rendered. There was an obligation of € 71 thousand as of the reporting date. 
Key management personnel have indirectly and at their own risk acquired an interest at market value in Rebecca MidCo 
S.à r.l., a parent company of RENK Group AG, through the self-financed purchase of shares from Rebecca Management 
S.C.A. and thus participate in the entrepreneurial risks and rewards. This is a share-based payment in accordance with 
IFRS 2. The investments were to be made by the respective participants upon signing of the investment agreement. As 
of the reporting date, these investors indirectly held approximately 2.4 % of RENK.  
The executives involved bear the risk of this investment as self-financed co-investors. In the event of an exit by the 
current principal shareholder, the participants will participate in any increase in value achieved. In the event that a 
participant terminates or has to terminate its participation prematurely, for whatever reason, Rebecca LuxCo S.à r.l., the 
majority shareholder of Rebecca Management S.C.A., has the option to acquire shares of the participant against cash 
payment. The purchase price amounts to the lower of the original investment or the market value as defined in the 
participation agreement – considering the share that has not yet vested, if applicable. This increases by 10 % every six 
months. The underlying terms and conditions depend on the reason for the termination but do not affect the value of the 
investment under IFRS 2. Neither RENK Group AG nor any of its subsidiaries is at any time obligated to make any 
payment to the participants. 
According to IFRS 2, these investments are share-based payments. At the time of acquisition of the investments (in 
2021 and 2022), the purchase price to be paid was at least equal to the fair value of the investment received. The fair 
value was determined by carrying forward the business valuation performed in connection with the acquisition by Triton. 
As the fair value of the investment at the time of acquisition was paid by the parties involved, no monetary benefit was 
granted. As a result, no personnel expenses are to be recognized at the level of RENK over the entire period of the plan.

32. Earnings per share 
For calculating earnings per share, profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is divided by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares (including potential ordinary shares) that will be outstanding during the 
year. Dilution effects are not applicable during the periods presented. 
The number of shares used for computation of earnings per share reflect the change of legal form as if it had occurred 
on January 1, 2022. Since August 9, 2023, prior to the change of legal form, the subscribed capital of the Company has 
been increased to € 100 million, consisting in into total of 100 million shares with a notional par value of € 1.00 each. 
The representation of the earnings per share is consistent with the principles in IAS 33.64, which requires calculation of 
earnings per share (undiluted and diluted) for all periods. 
 
33. Executive Board remuneration 
The remuneration of the Executive Board members of RENK Group AG consists of a fixed remuneration and a variable 
remuneration. Executive Board members also receive a pension commitment. The total remuneration granted for 
managing director and Executive Board activities in fiscal year 2023 amounted to € 1,384 thousand in accordance with 
Section 314 para. no. 6a HGB and IFRS. Of this amount, € 951.5 thousand is attributable to the period of managing 
director activity and € 432.5 thousand to the period of Management Board activity.

34. Supervisory Board remuneration  
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is regulated in the Articles of Association. They provide for 
fixed annual remuneration of € 60 thousand per member of the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board receives twice the amount and the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board one and a half times the fixed 
annual remuneration. The members of the Supervisory Board also receive additional fixed annual remuneration of                       
€ 10 thousand each for their work on the Audit Committee and the Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee receives two and a half times this fixed annual remuneration. The Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee receives twice the amount of this fixed annual remuneration. The members of the Supervisory 
Board and the committees also receive an attendance fee of € 500 per meeting. All the aforementioned remuneration 
components are payable at the end of the financial year. Supervisory Board members who were only in office for part of 
the financial year receive a corresponding pro rata remuneration as a member or chairman of a committee. The following 
table includes the pro rata fixed remuneration for the financial year, considering the corresponding factor, as well as the 
variable attendance fees per Supervisory Board member.

35. Events after the reporting period 
Events after the balance sheet date were evaluated up to the date of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. There were no events that must be recognized or disclosed by the date of publication of the consolidated 
financial statements, with the exception of those mentioned below. 
Dr. Emmerich Schiller was appointed by the Supervisory Board as a Managing Director of RENK GmbH with 
responsibility for the Production division with effect from February 1, 2024. Dr. Alexander Sagel was appointed by the 
Supervisory Board as a member of the Executive Board with effect from April 1, 2024. Dr. Sagel will be responsible for 
the operational management of the Vehicle Mobility Solutions (VMS), Marine & Industry (M&I) and Slide Bearings (SB) 
segments. Dr. Rainer Martens resigned from the Supervisory Board of RENK Group AG and RENK GmbH with effect 
from February 22, 2024. On March 14, 2024, Mr. Florian Hohenwarter was appointed to the Supervisory Board of RENK 
Group AG until the next Annual General Meeting by court order of the Augsburg Local Court and to the Supervisory 
Board of RENK GmbH for the remainder of Dr. Martens' term of office by shareholder resolution dated March 14, 2024. 
On February 7, 2024, RENK successfully completed its Private Placement on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The shares 
have since been traded on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. RENK issued 100 
million ordinary shares. The financial investor Triton placed 33.33 million RENK shares with institutional investors at an 
issuance price of € 15.00 per share and thus generated proceeds from the issue in the amount of € 500,000 thousand. 
As at February 29, 2024, the company had 100 million ordinary shares outstanding. 
As part of a private placement, certain members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and selected individuals 
had the opportunity to acquire shares and thus receive a preferential allocation in connection with this private placement. 
Various members of RENK's management and closely related persons made use of this option. An overview of the 
director dealings can be found at https://ir.renk.com/de/corporate-governance/#director-dealings. 
On February 18 and 19, 2024, RENK also completed the refinancing of its debt. The € 520,000 thousand corporate bond 
(5.75 % senior secured notes maturing in 2025) was repaid early on February 20, 2024 and replaced by a 
€ 525,000 thousand term loan (TLB) from a consortium of banks. The term loan has a term of 5 years and is 
supplemented by a € 450,000s thousand multi-currency guarantee facility and a € 75,000 thousand revolving credit 
facility, which will remain unused until further notice. The variable interest rate of the term loan was hedged for a large 
part of the corresponding volume for three years. This was accompanied by the termination of the existing guarantee 
facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) 2020 and the implementation of the new SFA 2023. On December, 
22 2023, the UniCredit guarantee facility under the SFA 2020 was increased from € 80,000 thousand to € 110,000 
thousand in order to serve as a security measure in the event of a failure or delay in the IPO and refinancing. The 
associated upfront fee (€ 300 thousand) was paid on January 22, 2024. This guarantee facility has since been included 
in the SFA 2023. Bank fees of € 10,000 thousand (gross, excluding legal costs) were incurred for the refinancing. 
On February 21, 2024, RENK GmbH entered into an interest rate swap agreement with UniCredit Bank GmbH with effect 
from February 26, 2024 to hedge the TLB. The forward transaction is a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement 
with an initial nominal amount of € 350,000 thousand. The term of the agreement is three years and terminates on 
February 26, 2027. RENK GmbH pays interest quarterly, starting on February 26, 2024, up to and including the end date 
of the agreement, at a fixed interest rate of 2.845 % and receives quarterly interest payments calculated over the same 
period at the 3-month EUR-EURIBOR-Reuters rate.  
On February 23, 2024, the rating agency Moody's raised the corporate credit rating (CFR) of RENK GmbH to Ba3 
(previously B1) and the outlook to "positive" (previously "stable"). At that time, Moody's justified the upgrade of RENK's 
corporate rating by several rating classes (notches) by RENK's "relatively conservative and balanced financial policy" 
and its "robust credit metrics" for the future.

Independet Auditor’s Report 
To RENK Group AG, Augsburg 
Audit Opinions 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of RENK Group AG, Augsburg, and its subsidiaries (the Group), 
which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes 
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have 
audited the group management report of RENK Group AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In 
accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement on corporate 
governance pursuant to § [Article] 289f Abs. [paragraph] 4 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] 
(disclosures on the quota for women on executive boards).  
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,  
 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the 
Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 
December 2023, and 
 
the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all 
material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies 
with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. 
Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating 
to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 
Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance 
with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated 
by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those 
requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the 
group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled 
our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report.  
Other Information 
The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement on 
corporate governance pursuant to § 289f Abs. 4 HGB (disclosures on the quota for women on executive boards) as an 
unaudited part of the group management report. 
The other information comprises the annual report – excluding cross-references to external information – with the 
exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor’s 
report. 
Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other 
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

RENK Group AG  |  Geschäftsbericht 2023 
C. Additional Information
 
128
 
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to 
consider whether the other information  
 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report 
disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory 
Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report 
The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all 
material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law 
pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, 
the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., 
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting 
unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a 
whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements 
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report 
that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate 
evidence for the assertions in the group management report. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole 
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 
317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by 
the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management 
report. 
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
C. Additional Information
 
129 
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of 
arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the 
effectiveness of these systems. 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a 
going concern. 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional 
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB. 
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinions. 
 
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity 
with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. 
 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group 
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant 
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper 
derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on 
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that 
future events will differ materially from the prospective information. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.

3 Supervisory Board Report 
Dear Shareholders, 
A year full of positive developments, but also challenging ones, lies behind us. Please permit us to make one 
observation at the outset from the perspective of the Supervisory Board: During this time, RENK has evolved, one could 
say partially reinvented itself. Above all, though, all of the employees of RENK have demonstrated that the road to 
success is paved with quality and passion. 
In (geo)political terms, the 2023 financial year was primarily characterized by increasing conflict hotspots. This 
persistent uncertainty and successive crises are shaping the framework conditions under which RENK operates as a 
partner for safe, innovative and sustainable mobility and drive solutions. 
In the midst of this environment, RENK was able to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2023 and at the same time record 
sales growth and strong order intake. For RENK as a company, the 2023 financial year was furthermore characterized 
by the ongoing transformation and preparation for the IPO of RENK Group AG. 
And now to briefly touch on the formalities: Through a change of legal form by shareholder resolution of September 12, 
2023 and entry in the commercial register on September 13, 2023, RENK Group AG emerged from RENK Holding 
GmbH, which was founded in 2020 (Augsburg Local Court HRB 37339). The initial public offering of RENK Group AG 
shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, originally planned for October 5, 2023, was postponed due to a gloomy market 
environment. However, the company still remained prepared for the capital market. The shares of RENK Group AG were 
first listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on February 7, 2024. 
In preparation for the change of legal form and the IPO, a Supervisory Board was appointed for the first time at RENK 
Holding GmbH, today's RENK Group AG, in August 2023: The appointment of the shareholder representatives was 
effected by a shareholder resolution of August 9, 2023. The employee representatives were appointed by order of the 
Augsburg Local Court dated August 23, 2023. This Supervisory Board established at RENK Holding GmbH continued to 
exist unchanged following the change of legal form to a stock corporation at RENK Group AG in accordance with Section 
203 s. 1 of the German Transformation Act (UmwG). 
3.1 Collaboration with the Management Board 
Since its constitution, the Supervisory Board of RENK Group AG has carried out the tasks assigned to it by law, the 
Articles of Association and Rules of Procedure. The Supervisory Board was involved directly and at an early stage in all 
decisions of fundamental importance for the company. The Management Board regularly informed the Supervisory 
Board, both in writing and orally, in a timely and comprehensive manner, about corporate planning, business progress, 
strategic development and the current situation of the company and the group, including the IPO. The cooperation 
between the Supervisory Board and the Management Board was open and trusting at all times. The Supervisory Board 
received the information it considers necessary to advise the Management Board and monitor its activities in accordance 
with the statutory requirements.  
The Management Board coordinated the strategic direction of the company with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory 
Board discussed the business transactions that are significant for the company in detail based on the reports from the 
Management Board. Deviations in the business process from the plans were extensively discussed with the Supervisory 
Board. 
The Supervisory Board, in particular the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairwoman of the Audit 
Committee, were in regular contact with the Management Board beyond the Supervisory Board meetings and regularly 
obtained and exchanged information about current developments regarding the company's strategy, financing situation, 
risk and compliance. In this way, the Supervisory Board was always aware of the intended business policy, the business 
development and profitability of the company, the corporate planning including financial, investment and personnel 
planning, the risk situation, risk management and compliance including the situation of the group.

3.2 Corporate Governance and Working Procedure of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board takes into account the principles and regulations on corporate governance for companies, in 
particular the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK), and regularly monitors their 
development.  
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible to undertake training and further education 
measures. The company supports the Supervisory Board to an appropriate extent with financial and human resources in 
order to facilitate the introduction of members of the Supervisory Board to their office and to enable such further training 
that is necessary to maintain the required level of expertise. For the financial year 2023 in particular, a teach-in was 
carried out for the members of the Audit Committee on the topic of corporate sustainability reporting, especially on the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD incl. EU Taxonomy). 
3.3 Discussions and Resolutions in the Plenary Session of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board of RENK Group AG (at the time still operating as RENK Holding GmbH) was appointed in August 
2023. In total, four meetings of the Supervisory Board of RENK Holding GmbH and RENK Group AG have taken place 
since the Supervisory Board was constituted in the 2023 financial year.  
The constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place on September 1, 2023. At this meeting, in particular, the 
members of the Mediation Committee were elected in accordance with Section 27 para. 3 of the German 
Codetermination Act (MitbestG) and the Supervisory Board adopted initial Rules of Procedure, which were further 
adapted in the following meetings. In addition, target figures for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board and 
in management were set in accordance with Section 52 para. 2 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG). 
The preparation of the change of legal form and the IPO, including the associated measures and decisions, was one of 
the main topics for the Supervisory Board in the past financial year, especially for the meetings of September 12 and 
September 21, 2023. In this respect, the Supervisory Board primarily dealt with the requirements relating to the 
corporate governance of RENK Group AG as a future listed company. Among other things, it appointed the members of 
the Nomination and Audit Committee and, in accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code, decided on a competence profile for members and concrete goals for the composition of the 
Supervisory Board. Furthermore, in addition to the Management Board members of RENK Group AG, it appointed the 
labor director in accordance with Section 33 para. 1 s. 1 German Co-determination Act (MitbestG), approved the 
employment contracts of the Management Board members, issued Rules of Procedure for the Management Board and 
established a remuneration system for the Management Board in accordance with Sections 87 and 87a of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG). In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board approved the founding audit report 
regarding the change of legal form from RENK Holding GmbH to RENK Group AG. Furthermore, at the Supervisory 
Board meeting of December 19, 2023, the Personnel Committee was implemented and the target values for the bonuses 
of the Management Board members were set. 
At the meetings of the Supervisory Board of September 21, 2023 and December 19, 2023, the Management Board 
reported on the current business situation and development, the order situation, the status of significant orders and M&A 
activities as well as governance and compliance issues, in particular with regard to risk management, export control 
system, data protection and compliance training and incidents. To this end, the financial information regarding the 
financial year, in particular the interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2023, was discussed. After the 
Management Board addressed (re)financing issues at the meeting of September 21, 2023, the Supervisory Board 
approved the conclusion of the financing documents. At the meeting of December 19, 2023, the approval on the 
business plan of RENK Group AG was resolved. 
The members of the Management Board took part in select Supervisory Board meetings. However, members of the 
Management Board were not present during discussions and resolutions regarding the appointment of Management 
Board members as well as the conclusion of Management Board service contracts and the target values of Management 
Board bonuses.

After thorough examination and consultation, the Supervisory Board approved the resolutions proposed by the 
Management Board on measures that require the consent of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Articles of 
Association, the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board and the Rules of Procedure for the Management Board. 
In addition to the individual measures already explained, there are no further events to be reported in the past financial 
year in relation to measures requiring consent. 
3.4 Committees of the Supervisory Board 
In order to carry out its tasks efficiently, the Supervisory Board set up four permanent committees in the 2023 financial 
year: the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Mediation Committee and the Personnel Committee. These 
committees prepare the resolutions of the Supervisory Board as well as the topics to be discussed in the plenary 
sessions. To the extent permitted by law, tasks and decision-making powers of the Supervisory Board have been 
transferred to the relevant committees. 
The Audit Committee held two meetings in which the members of the Management Board and employees of the Finance 
Department as well as representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft ("PwC" or the 
"Auditor") also took part. In its constituent meeting as the Audit Committee of RENK Group AG of September 21, 2023, 
the Audit Committee agreed and passed a resolution on the further planning and priorities of the annual and 
consolidated financial statements audit for 2023. With a view to the regulations for listed stock corporations, to which the 
company is subject once the application for admission to the stock exchange is submitted, the Audit Committee decided 
to supplement the audit mandate for PwC. Accordingly, a report on capital market viability was prepared. In both, the 
meeting of September 21, 2023 and the meeting of December 18, 2023, the interim financial information was explained, 
in particular based on the interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2023, and reports on compliance were 
submitted. Furthermore, at the meeting of the Audit Committee of December 18, 2023, the new organization of the 
Finance Department, information on the requirements and design of financial reporting for 2023 and on the status of the 
2023 annual financial statements audit were presented, alongside a report from the Internal Audit Department. 
Furthermore, the current status and planning for the risk management system and the internal control system as well as 
the planning regarding the implementation of requirements related to CSRD and the EU taxonomy were explained in this 
meeting and the committee members were given a teach-in on the topic of CSRD. 
The committee chairwoman reported on the work of the Audit Committee in the plenary sessions of September 21, 2023, 
and December 19, 2023. 
The Nomination Committee, the Mediation Committee and the Personnel Committee did not hold any meetings in the 
2023 financial year.

In addition, the Supervisory Board held a meeting as the Supervisory Board of the then-RENK Holding GmbH on 
September 1, 2023, before the resolution to change of legal form was adopted by the shareholder. Mr. Evers and Mr. 
Stahlmann were excused from the meeting of the Supervisory Board on September 12, 2023, and Mr. Ott was excused 
from the meeting on September 21, 2023. The absent members submitted voting notifications in advance to participate 
in the resolutions. Apart from this, all current members of the Supervisory Board and the committees were present or all 
meetings in the 2023 financial year.  
Attendance at the meetings of the Supervisory Board in the past financial year, based on the period after the resolution 
to change of legal form, equalled 91.67 % on average, and 100 % without exception at the meetings of the committees. 
In the reporting year, no member of the Supervisory Board attended only half or less than half of the meetings of the 
Supervisory Board and the committees to which that member belongs. 
Resolutions were adopted by the Supervisory Board and the committees in meetings that were held primarily in virtual 
form. The meetings of the Supervisory Board of September 1, 2023, September 12, 2023, and September 21, 2023 were 
held as video conferences. The meeting of the Supervisory Board of December 19, 2023 took place as a face-to-face 
meeting, with one guest joining virtually. 
In the current financial year 2024, the Supervisory Board held an extraordinary meeting on February 21, 2024, and an 
ordinary meeting on March 26, 2024, and the Audit Committee held an ordinary meeting on March 25, 2024. 
3.6 Conflicts of Interest on the Supervisory Board 
Conflicts of interest of members of the Management Board or the Supervisory Board that should have been disclosed to 
the Supervisory Board were not reported in the past financial year. 
3.7 Changes on the Management Board and Supervisory Board 
The following changes occurred in the management or Management Board in the past financial year: By resolution of the 
shareholders' meeting of RENK Holding GmbH on June 2, 2023, the appointment of Mr. Niklas Beyes as managing 
director was revoked and Mr. Christian Schulz was appointed as managing director with immediate effect. The changes 
thus took place before the constitution of the Supervisory Board and the effectiveness of the change of legal form. 
There were no changes to the Supervisory Board in the past financial year.

3.8 Annual and Consolidated Financial Statements Audit 
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was elected as Auditor for the 2023 financial year by 
resolution of the shareholders' meeting of RENK Holding GmbH on September 12, 2023, in accordance with Section 197 
s. 1 UmwG in conjunction with Section 30 para. 1 s. 1 AktG. PwC, with Holger Graßnick and Dario Nikolic as the 
responsible auditors and Holger Graßnick as the responsible auditor and partner, audited the annual financial 
statements of RENK Holding GmbH as well as the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 
for the first time in the 2022 financial year in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code (HGB). For 
the 2020 and 2021 financial years, the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as 
the group management report of RENK Holding GmbH were audited by Ernst & Young GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft ("EY"). The Supervisory Board also dealt with the supplementary audits for the 2021 
and 2022 financial years that have since been published. 
The Management Board of RENK Group AG prepared the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial 
statements and the group management report of RENK Group AG for the 2023 financial year. 
PwC audited the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report of 
RENK Group AG for the 2023 financial year and issued an unqualified audit certificate in each case dated March 25, 
2024. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Section 315a HGB on the basis of the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as they are applicable in the European Union, and the additional 
German statutory provisions applicable in accordance with Section 315e para. 1 HGB. The annual financial statements 
and the group management report were prepared in accordance with German commercial law regulations. 
The Auditor carried out the annual and consolidated financial statements audit in accordance with Section 317 HGB and 
the German principles of proper auditing established by the German Institute of Public Accountants (IDW). 
The documents mentioned were distributed to us by the Management Board in a timely manner. They were discussed 
intensively in the Audit Committee on March 25, 2024. The Auditor's audit report was provided to all members of the 
Supervisory Board and was discussed in detail at the Supervisory Board's balance sheet meeting on March 26, 2024, in 
the presence of the Auditor, who reported on the key results of his audit. At this meeting, the annual financial statements 
and the consolidated financial statements were elucidated with the Management Board and the scope, focus and costs 
of the audit were presented. 
We agree with the results of the final audit. Based on the final results of the audit by the Audit Committee and our own 
examination, no objections are to be raised. The Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements of RENK 
Group AG prepared by the Management Board and the consolidated financial statements of the RENK Group prepared 
by the Management Board. The annual financial statements are therefore approved in accordance with Section 172 
AktG. The Supervisory Board and the Management Board propose that the retained earnings of the separate financial 
statements of RENK Group AG as of December 31, 2023 should be used in an amount of € 30,000 thousand to 
distribute a dividend of € 0.30 per dividend-entitled share and that the dividend payment should be made from the capital 
reserve in accordance with Section 272 para. 2 no. 4 HGB. The Supervisory Board considers this proposal to be 
appropriate and has therefore approved it. 
In 2023, RENK was not yet obliged to report on non-financial key figures in accordance with Section 315b HGB. 
Nevertheless, a voluntary sustainability report was created. The sustainability report was audited by PwC on behalf of 
the Management Board of the RENK Group AG for the purpose of obtaining limited assurance and provided with a 
corresponding audit declaration; it is available on the company's homepage. The Supervisory Board also took note of the 
sustainability report. 
3.9 Audit of the Management Board's report on relations with affiliated enterprises 
In accordance with Section 312 AktG, the Management Board of RENK Group AG prepared a report on relations with 
affiliated enterprises (Dependency Report) for the period from September 13 to December 31, 2023 and, in accordance 
with Section 314 AktG, submitted it to the Supervisory Board in a timely manner for review. The Dependency Report was 
audited by the Auditor in accordance with Section 313 AktG. Since there were no objections to be raised based on the 

RENK Group AG  |  Annual Report 2023 
C. Additional Information
 
135 
 
final results of its audit, the Auditor issued, in accordance with Section 313 para. 3 AktG, the following unqualified audit 
certificate: "After our due examination and assessment, we confirm that (1.) the statements of fact in the report are correct, 
(2.) the company's tradeoff in the legal transactions listed in the report was not unreasonably high, (3.) in the measures 
listed in the report, there are no circumstances supporting a materially different assessment than that made by the 
Management Board." 
The Dependency Report and the Auditor's audit report were provided to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board 
and were reviewed by them. This audit did not lead to any complaints. Based on the final results of the preliminary audit 
by the Audit Committee and our own examination, the Supervisory Board has no objections to the Management Board's 
declaration on relations with affiliated enterprises. The result of the Auditor's review of the Dependency Report is approved. 
The Auditor's audit certificate for the Dependency Report for the 2023 financial year reads verbatim as follows: 
Audit result and audit certificate 
In accordance with our engagement, we examined the report of the Management Board in accordance with Section 312 
AktG on relations with affiliated enterprises in accordance with Section 313 AktG for the 2023 financial year. Since there 
are no objections to be raised based on the final results of our audit, we issue the following audit certificate in accordance 
with Section 313 para. 3 sentence 1 AktG: 
After our due examination and assessment, we confirm that 
1. the statements of fact in the report are correct, 
2. the company's tradeoff in the legal transactions listed in the report was not unreasonably high, 
3. in the measures listed in the report, there are no circumstances supporting a materially different assessment than that 
made by the Management Board.
