Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
of TRATON GROUP for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 
1. Basis of presentation 
GENE RAL I NFORMATION 
TRATON SE (“the Company”, “TRATON”), formerly Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH, Volkswagen Truck & Bus AG, TRATON AG, 
was converted into a public company by shareholder resolution of June 14, 2018. The change in legal form became effective 
upon the registration in the commercial register on June 26, 2018. From August 30, 2018 to January 16, 2019 the Company, 
formerly named Volkswagen Truck & Bus AG, operated under the name TRATON AG. With effect from May 18, 2018, the 
Company’s registered office was transferred from Braunschweig to Munich, Germany. By resolution of December 14, 2018 the 
Company changed its legal form to a European Stock Corporation (Societas Europaea/SE). The change in legal form became 
effective upon the registration in the commercial register on January 17, 2019. Since then TRATON is registered in the 
commercial register at the Munich Local Court under No. 246068. 
TRATON with its brands MAN, Scania, Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, and RIO is a commercial vehicle manufacturer. Its 
offering comprises light-duty commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses, as well as the sale of related genuine parts and customer 
services. The RIO brand provides a growing portfolio of digital services and solutions. In addition, TRATON offers a wide array 
of financial services for commercial vehicle customers. 
The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. TRATON SE is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Volkswagen 
Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg (Volkswagen AG). TRATON SE and its subsidiaries (“TRATON GROUP”) are included in 
Volkswagen AG’s consolidated financial statements, which are published in the Bundesanzeiger (German Federal Gazette).  
In accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, TRATON GROUP prepared its 
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 in compliance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. We have complied with all the IFRSs 
adopted by the EU and required to be applied. The Executive Board prepared these consolidated financial statements on  
February 14, 2019, and resolved to authorize them for submission to the Supervisory Board. On that date, the period ended in 
which adjusting events after the reporting period are recognized.  
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are given in millions of 
euros (€ million). All figures are shown rounded, so minor discrepancies may arise from addition of these amounts. 
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates that 
affect the reported amounts of certain items in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated income statement, as 
well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The consolidated financial statements present fairly the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations as well as the cash flows of the TRATON GROUP. 
FI RST-TIME ADOPTION OF I FRS  
These consolidated financial statements, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, are the first the TRATON 
GROUP has prepared in accordance with IFRS as it is a first-time adopter. Accordingly, the Group has prepared consolidated 
financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable as of December 31, 2018. In preparing the consolidated financial 
statements, the Group’s opening consolidated balance sheet was prepared as of January 1, 2016, the Group’s date of transition 
to IFRS.  
As the Group did not previously prepare any consolidated financial statements, no reconciliation of equity according to IFRS 1 
is required for the purpose of these consolidated financial statements. The TRATON GROUP did not apply any optional 
exemptions from retrospective application of IFRS. 

12 
 
GROU P RE STRUCTU RI NG PROCESS 
The TRATON GROUP in its current structure was set up in several steps following a reorganization of Volkswagen AG’s 
Commercial Vehicles business area. In April 2013, Volkswagen AG contributed its 75.2% shareholding in MAN SE to TRATON 
for no consideration. In August 2013, Volkswagen AG merged its 100% interest in Volkswagen Gebrauchtfahrzeughandels und 
Service GmbH („VGSG“) into Volkswagen Qualifizierungsgesellschaft GmbH, a subsidiary of TRATON. After the merger, the 
name of VGSG was continued. In a next step, in March 2016, Volkswagen contributed its 86% interest in Scania Aktiebolag 
(“Scania AB”) to TRATON for no consideration. Together with the shares in Scania held by MAN SE, TRATON now is the sole 
shareholder of Scania AB. The contributions in kind from Volkswagen AG were recognized in TRATON’s capital reserve.  
As TRATON and Scania were controlled by Volkswagen AG both before and after the contribution of Scania into TRATON, this 
business combination is a common control transaction. As such, TRATON has applied the accounting policy to show Scania in 
its consolidated financial statements at the book values of its ultimate parent, Volkswagen AG. This also includes the 
adjustments of Scania book values at Volkswagen AG level resulting from the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) effected 
following the acquisition of Scania by Volkswagen AG in 2008, including goodwill resulting from this transaction. In addition, 
TRATON has applied the accounting policy for business combinations under common control to restate its carrying amounts 
before the date of the transaction to present its consolidated financial statements as if the combination had occurred before 
the start of the earliest date presented (i.e. January 1, 2016). 
The book values of MAN SE were continued in the TRATON consolidated financial statements and thus do not include the PPA 
values resulting from the acquisition of MAN SE by Volkswagen AG. This is because the contribution of MAN SE into TRATON 
in 2013 represented a group reorganization and did not meet the definition of a business combination. The difference between 
the value of the MAN SE shares at which they were contributed to TRATON SE and the recognized book value of corresponding 
assets and liabilities was recognized in retained earnings. 
In October 2018, TRATON decided to sell its Power Engineering business (comprising large-bore diesel and gas engines, 
turbomachinery, industrial turbines, chemical reactor systems, special gear units, propulsion components and testing 
systems) to a Volkswagen Group entity outside the TRATON GROUP. The sale comprised the shares of TRATON (held indirectly 
through MAN SE or one of its subsidiaries) in Power Engineering, i.e. the 76% stake in RENK Aktiengesellschaft (RENK), the 
100% stake in MAN Energy Solutions SE (MAN ES) and the 100% stake in MAN Energy Solutions USA Inc. (MAN ES USA). In 
addition, three German real-estate holding companies held by MAN SE were included in the sale. The share purchase 
agreements for the sale were signed on December 20, 2018 and the sale was effected on December 31, 2018. The aggregate 
purchase price for the stakes in MAN ES and RENK amounted to €1,874 million. The purchase price for the stake in MAN ES 
USA amounted to approximately €87 million. The aggregate purchase prices for the three real estate companies amounted to 
approximately €20 million. 
In addition, as per January 1, 2019, VGSG was sold for a consideration of €113 thousand to a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG 
outside the TRATON GROUP. 
NEW AND AMENDED I FRSs NOT YE T APPLI ED 
TRATON has adopted and applied consistently over all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements all 
accounting standards mandatorily effective for the first-time as of the year end 2018, including IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, 
and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The following new or amended standards and interpretations will only 
become mandatory in the EU in subsequent financial years. With the exception of IFRS 16, Leases, this is not expected to have 
any significant effect to TRATON.  
The Group does not intend to early-adopt any of the standards or amendments.

3 Minor amendments to a number of IFRSs (IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12, and IAS 23). 
 
I FRS 16 – LEASES 
IFRS 16 changes the accounting requirements for leases and replaces the previous standard IAS 17 and related interpretations. 
The main objective of IFRS 16 is to recognize all leases on the consolidated balance sheet. It establishes that lessees are no 
longer required to classify their leases as finance leases or operating leases. In the future, they will instead be required to 
recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases on the consolidated balance sheet. Exceptions will only be made 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The right-of-use asset must be amortized over the lease term and the lease 
liability adjusted using the effective interest method, taking into account the lease payments. Lessor accounting largely 
corresponds to the current provisions of IAS 17. In the future, lessors will continue to classify their leases as finance leases or 
operating leases based on the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset. 
The TRATON GROUP applies the modified retrospective transition method for the first-time adoption of IFRS 16. As a result of 
the first-time recognition of the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities at the same amount the consolidated 
balance sheet total will increase according to the preliminary assessment by approximately 2%. The increase in financial 
liabilities has a negative impact on the net liquidity of the TRATON GROUP. No significant impact on equity is expected. In 
contrast to the previous approach to include expenses for operating leases in the operating profit, under IFRS 16 only the 
amortization of the right-of-use assets is included in the operating profit. Interest expenses from the compounding of the 
lease liability are shown in the financial result. Based on the lease contracts existing as of January 1, 2019, an increase in 
operating profit in the low two-digit millions of euros is expected. The changed recognition of expenses from operating leases 
in the consolidated cash flow statement results in a slight improvement of the cash flow from operating activities and an 
equivalent decline of the cash flow from financing activities.  
The application of IFRS 16 will also lead to far more extensive disclosures.  
2. Basis of consolidation 
In addition to TRATON SE, the consolidated financial statements comprise all significant subsidiaries that are controlled 
directly or indirectly by TRATON SE. This is the case if TRATON SE obtains power over the potential subsidiaries directly or 

14 
 
indirectly from voting rights or similar rights, is exposed, or has rights to, positive or negative variable returns from its 
involvement with the subsidiaries, and is able to influence those returns. Consolidation of subsidiaries begins at the first date 
on which control exists, and ends when such control no longer exists. Subsidiaries that are acquired during the fiscal year are 
consolidated from the date when control exists. Companies that are disposed of in the fiscal year are deconsolidated from the 
date when control no longer exists.  
Subsidiaries whose business is dormant or of low volume and that are insignificant, both individually and in the aggregate, for 
the fair presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as the cash flows of the TRATON 
GROUP are not consolidated.  
Significant companies where TRATON is able, directly or indirectly, to significantly influence financial and operating policy 
decisions (associates), or that are directly or indirectly jointly controlled (joint ventures), are accounted for using the equity 
method. As a rule, significant influence is assumed when TRATON holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Associates 
also include companies where TRATON has significant influence through participation in financial and operating policy 
decisions without having control. Insignificant associates and joint ventures are carried at cost net of any impairment losses 
and reversals of impairment losses required to be recognized.  
All other investees are financial investments.

The increase of deconsolidated entities in 2018 is mainly due to the sale of the Power Engineering business (see note 
“Noncurrent Assets held for sale and discontinued operations”). 
The list of all shareholdings that form part of the annual consolidated financial statements of TRATON GROUP can be found in 
Annex 1. 
The assets and liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in accordance with 
the uniform accounting policies used within the TRATON GROUP. In the case of companies accounted for using the equity 
method, the same accounting policies are applied to determine the proportionate equity, based on the most recent audited 
annual consolidated financial statements of each company. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. In the case of subsidiaries consolidated 
for the first time, assets and liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Their carrying amounts are 
adjusted in subsequent years. Goodwill arises when the consideration paid for the investment exceeds the fair value of 
identifiable net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year to determine whether its carrying amount is recoverable. 
If the carrying amount of goodwill is higher than the recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized. If the 
consideration paid for the investment is less than the identifiable net assets, the difference is recognized in the consolidated 
income statement in the year of acquisition. Any difference that arises from the acquisition of additional shares of an already 
consolidated subsidiary is taken directly to equity. Unless otherwise stated, the proportionate equity directly attributable to 
noncontrolling interests is determined at the acquisition date as the share of the fair value of the assets (excluding goodwill) 
and liabilities attributable to them. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration do not result in the adjustment of the acquisition-date measurement. 
Acquisition-related costs that are not equity transaction costs are not added to the consideration paid, but instead are 
recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 
The consolidation process involves adjusting the items in the separate financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries 
and presenting them as if they were those of a single economic entity. Intragroup assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows are eliminated in full. Intercompany profits or losses are eliminated in Group inventories and noncurrent 
assets. Deferred taxes are recognized for consolidation adjustments, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where 
taxes are levied by the same tax authority and relate to the same tax period. 
CU RRENCY TRA NSLATION 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated in the single-entity financial statements of TRATON SE and its consolidated 
subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign currency monetary items are recorded in the balance sheet 
using the middle rate at the closing date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated income 
statement.  
The financial statements of foreign companies are translated into euros using the functional currency concept, under which 
asset and liability items are translated at the closing rate. With the exception of gains and losses recognized directly in equity, 
equity is translated at historical rates. The resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive 
income until disposal of the subsidiary concerned, and are presented as a separate item in equity. Income statement items are 
translated into euros at weighted average rates. 
The table below summarizes the principle exchange rates that have been used for foreign currency translation purposes of the 
Group:

HYPERI NFLATIONARY ECONOMI ES 
During 2018 Argentina was defined as a hyperinflationary economy and as a result the TRATON subsidiary Scania Argentina 
S.A. became hyperinflationary in that year. The entity has therefore adjusted its non-monetary items for inflation. The 
inflation adjustment has been remeasured using CPI Consumer Price index with an average rate of 184.13. The cumulative 
effect as of January 1, 2018 amounting to €48 million, net of tax, has been recognized in retained earnings, and adjustments of 
the year 2018 have been accounted for in other financial result. The figures in the TRATON consolidated financial statements 
for 2016 and 2017 have not been restated as they are presented in a currency which is that of a non-hyperinflationary 
economy. As from January 1, 2019 Scania Argentina S.A. will change its functional currency to USD as its economic 
environment is significantly influenced by the USD. As a result, non-monetary assets will no longer be inflation-adjusted from 
that date. 
3. Accounting policies 
With certain exceptions such as financial instruments measured at fair value and provisions for pensions and other post-
employment benefits, items in the TRATON GROUP are accounted for under the historical cost convention, adjusted for the 
effects of inflation where entities operate in hyperinflationary economies. The methods used to measure the individual items 
are explained in more detail below. 
In light of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement entered into by TRATON SE and Volkswagen AG, the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared following appropriation of net profit by Volkswagen AG. 
Profit and loss transfers from and to Volkswagen AG are shown directly in equity as transactions with the shareholder. 
The consolidated income statement was prepared using the cost of sales method. 
I NTANGI BLE ASSETS 
The intangible assets of the TRATON GROUP mainly include brands, customer relationships, software and capitalized 
development costs.  
Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost and amortized over their useful life using the straight-line method.  
Development costs for future series products and other internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at cost, provided 
manufacture of the products is likely to bring the TRATON GROUP an economic benefit. If the criteria for recognition as assets 
are not met, the expenses are recognized in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred. 
Research costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. Capitalized development costs include all direct and indirect costs 
that are directly attributable to the development process. The costs are amortized using the straight-line method from the start 
of production over the expected life cycle of the models or technology developed. 
Intangible assets acquired in the course of a business combination are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Brand names from business combinations usually have an indefinite useful life and therefore are not amortized. An indefinite 
useful life is usually the result of a brand’s further use and maintenance. 
The amortization period for software is mainly 3 to 5 years. Capitalized development costs are amortized over 3 to 10 years. 
Customer relationships are amortized over 20 years. 
Amortization recognized during the year is allocated to the relevant functions in the consolidated income statement. 
Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested for 
impairment at least once a year. Assets in use and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment only 
if there are specific indications that they may be impaired. The TRATON GROUP generally applies the higher of value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal of the relevant asset or cash-generating unit to determine the recoverability of goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the 
asset. If no recoverable amount can be measured for an individual asset, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows (cash-generating unit) to which the asset belongs. For 
impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. If an 
asset’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 

17 
 
Value in use is determined for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived 
intangible assets – mainly capitalized development costs – using the following pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 
rates, which are adjusted if necessary for country-specific discount factors:

The WACC rates are calculated based on the risk-free rate of interest, a market risk premium and the cost of debt. Additionally, 
specific peer group information on beta factors and leverage are taken into account. The composition of the peer groups used 
to determine beta factors is continuously reviewed and adjusted if necessary. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQU I PMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less depreciation and – where necessary – write-downs for impairment. Cost is 
determined based on the direct and indirect costs that are directly attributable. The production cost of internally 
manufactured items of property, plant, and equipment comprises directly attributable production costs and proportionate 
production overheads. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of assets that take a substantial period to get ready. 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. If items of property, 
plant, and equipment consist of significant identifiable components with different useful lives, such components are 
recognized and depreciated separately. The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on a regular 
basis and adjusted if required. 
Depreciation is based mainly on the following useful lives: buildings (10 to 100 years), site improvements (5 to 33 years), 
production plant and machinery (3 to 12 years), and other equipment, operating and office equipment (3 to 15 years). 
Where leased items of property, plant and equipment are used, the criteria for classification as a finance lease as set out in IAS 
17 are met if all material risks and rewards incidental to ownership have been transferred to the Group. In such cases, the 
assets concerned are recognized at fair value or at the present value of the minimum lease payments (if lower) and depreciated 
using the straight-line method over the asset’s useful life, or over the term of the lease if this is shorter. The payment 
obligations arising from the future lease payments are discounted and recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Where Group companies are the lessees of assets under operating leases, i.e. if not all material risks and rewards are 
transferred, lease and rental payments are recorded directly as expenses in profit or loss. 
I NVESTMENT PROPERTY 
Real estate and buildings held in order to obtain rental income (investment property) are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and (except for land) depreciated by the straight-line method over its estimated useful 
life; the useful lives applied to depreciation generally correspond to those of the property, plant and equipment used by the 
Group itself. The fair value of this investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair value is estimated using internal 
calculations or appraisals prepared by external experts (based on recognized valuation techniques). These can be reused in 
subsequent years by adjusting the changing variables. This procedure involves determining the income value based on the 
rental income, taking into account additional factors such as land value, remaining useful life, administrative and 
maintenance costs, and a multiplier specific to commercial property. For reasons of materiality, the disclosures on investment 
property are combined with the disclosures on property, plant, and equipment. 

18 
 
LEASE ASSETS 
Products sold with a buyback obligation are reported under “Lease assets” if TRATON GROUP retains the risks and rewards 
associated with the products. Vehicles leased out under operating leases are recognized at cost and depreciated to their 
estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Impairment losses identified as a result of 
an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 are recognized and the future depreciation rate is adjusted. The forecast residual 
values are adjusted to include constantly updated internal and external information on residual values, depending on specific 
local factors and the experiences gained in the marketing of used vehicles. 
EQU ITY-ACCOU NTED I NVESTMENTS 
Equity-method investments include associates and joint ventures. Associates and joint ventures are initially measured at cost. 
In subsequent periods, the TRATON GROUP’s share of profits and losses generated after acquisition is recognized in the 
consolidated income statement. Other changes in the equity of associates and joint ventures, such as currency translation 
differences, are recognized in other comprehensive income. Intercompany profits or losses from transactions by Group 
companies with associates and joint ventures are eliminated ratably in the profit or loss of the Group companies. If there are 
indications that the carrying amount may be impaired, equity-method investments are tested for impairment; any 
impairment loss and the reversal of a previous impairment loss are recognized in the financial result. 
The cost of equity-accounted investments is adjusted to reflect the share of increases or reductions in equity at the associates 
and joint ventures after the acquisition that is attributable to the TRATON GROUP, as well as any effects from purchase price 
allocation. 
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of an associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amounts of investments in 
associates or joint ventures.  
NON-DERIVATIVE FI NANCIAL I NSTRUMENTS  
Non-derivative financial instruments include in particular customer receivables, financial services receivables, loans, and cash 
and cash equivalents, as well as financial liabilities, trade payables, and liabilities from buyback obligations. Cash and cash 
equivalents include bank balances and highly liquid financial investments of a temporary nature that are exposed to no more 
than a minor risk of changes in value. Non-derivative financial instruments are accounted for at the settlement date in the case 
of regular way purchases or sales — that is, the date on which the asset is delivered. 
The TRATON GROUP uses the central cash management of the Volkswagen Group. Under a cash pooling process, the balances 
of the TRATON SE accounts included are closed out by Volkswagen AG, usually daily, and thus transformed into receivables 
from/liabilities to Volkswagen AG. As part of its central financial management, Volkswagen AG manages and guarantees the 
TRATON GROUP’s liquidity and credit supply with corresponding transactions on the international financial markets. Given 
their cash-like nature, TRATON GROUP reports the cash pool receivables with Volkswagen AG as cash and cash equivalents. By 
contrast, deposits of an investment nature are reported as marketable securities (current) or other financial assets (non-
current). Analogously, liabilities resulting from the central financial management of Volkswagen AG are reported as financial 
liabilities. 
RECOGNITION OF FI NANCIAL I NSTRUMENTS 
Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at their cost, which is equivalent to their fair value at that 
time plus/minus transaction costs, aside from those classified as financial instruments recognized at fair value through profit 
or loss. The last-mentioned category is recognized at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Trade receivables without a 
significant financing component are initially measured at their transaction price.  
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported at their gross carrying amounts. They are only offset if the 
TRATON GROUP has a currently enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to perform the settlement. 
 
CLASSI FICATION OF FI NANCIAL I NSTRUMENTS 
Financial instruments are classified as a financial asset, an equity instrument or a financial liability according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangement and the definitions in IAS 32. 
Financial assets (debt instruments) that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized cost (AC): 
 
 
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows; and 
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 

19 
 
 
Financial assets (debt instruments) that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI): 
 
 
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling the financial assets; and  
 
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
 
The TRATON GROUP elected to use the option of measuring investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading at 
FVOCI (without recycling), as presenting fair value gains and losses on such instruments in profit or loss is not indicative of the 
entity´s performance for TRATON Group. By default, all other financial assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). 
 
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories: 
 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; 
o 
Only financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit and loss. In the TRATON 
GROUP, only derivative financial instruments not included in hedge accounting meet this requirement. 
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. 
o 
By default, all other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. 
 
As a general principle, TRATON GROUP does not apply the fair value option for financial assets or financial liabilities. 
 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount: 
• 
at which a financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition; 
• 
minus any principal repayments; 
• 
plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial 
amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. 
 
The fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the fair value hierarchy, which is explained in the section “Additional 
financial instruments disclosures in accordance with IFRS 7” (Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at 
Amortized Cost by Level). 
 
IMPAI RMENT OF FI NANCIAL I NSTRUMENTS AND CONTRACT ASSETS 
The TRATON GROUP always recognizes lifetime ECL (expected credit loss) for trade receivables, lease receivables and contract 
assets. For trade receivables and contract assets lifetime ECL is estimated using a provision matrix as long as no objective 
evidence of individual credit-impairment is available. The provision matrix is based on the Group’s historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the 
current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. 
The provision rates depend on the number of days that a receivable is past due: 
 
Not impaired and not past due: 1.0% of the receivable; 
 
Past due up to 30 days: 1.5% of the receivable; 
 
Past due 31 to 90 days: 2.5% of the receivable; 
 
Past due more than 91 days: 4.0% of the receivable. 
For other financial instruments, the TRATON GROUP recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased 
significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal 
to 12 month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognized is based on significant increases in the 
likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition. If the internal risk management and control systems do not 
indicate a significant increase in credit risk any earlier, the rebuttable presumption within TRATON GROUP is that a significant 
increase in credit risk has occurred when payments are more than 30 days overdue. 

20 
 
Financial instruments are assigned to one of three credit risk stages: 
 
 
Stage 1: Financial instruments at initial recognition and no changes in credit risk 
 
Stage 2: Significant changes in credit risk on the basis of the lifetime expectation of the underlying contract 
 
Stage 3: Credit impaired financial instruments 
 
The assignment to the different stages is evaluated in every reporting period. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or 
more events have occurred that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flow. Such events comprise situations 
of delayed payment over a certain period, the institution of enforcement measures, the threat of insolvency or 
overindebtedness, the application for or opening of bankruptcy proceedings, or the failure of reorganization measures. The 
measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and the exposure at 
default. If there is no reason to assume a default has occurred any earlier based on the internal risk management and control 
systems, the general presumption in the TRATON GROUP is that a default has occurred when payments are more than 90 days 
overdue. 
For financial assets, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to 
TRATON GROUP in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate. For lease receivables, the cash flows and discount rates used for determining the expected credit 
losses are consistent with the cash flows and discount rates used in measuring the lease receivable in accordance with IAS 17 
“Leases”. 
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOU NTI NG  
TRATON GROUP is exposed to various financial risks in its operations. In order to hedge currency rate risks, interest rate risks 
and commodity price risks, companies use appropriate derivatives such as swaps, forward transactions and options. 
Derivatives are recognized initially and at the end of each subsequent reporting period at fair value. They are generally 
recognized at the trade date. 
The recognition of gains and losses from fair value measurement depends on the designation of the derivative. Derivatives 
that do not meet the IFRS 9 hedge accounting criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (also referred to below 
as derivatives not included in hedging relationships). These gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement are 
reported in other operating income and expenses, or in the financial result, depending on the risk covered by the derivative. 
The criteria for the application of hedge accounting are that the hedging relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument is clearly documented and that there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument, which is not dominated by the effect of credit risk. The hedging instruments are affected by the same risk 
as the hedged items, foreign exchange rate risk. In each hedging relationship for which hedge accounting is applied, the 
designated amount of the hedged item equals the volume of the hedging instrument. In the case of hedges of future cash flows 
(cash flow hedges), the hedging instruments are measured at fair value. Gains or losses from remeasurement of the effective 
designated portion of the derivative are initially recognized in the reserve for cash flow hedges in other comprehensive 
income, whereas gains or losses from the non-designated forward element of the derivative and the cross currency basis 
spread are recognized in the reserve for cost of hedging. The amounts cumulated in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to the consolidated income statement once the hedged future cash flow affects profit or loss. The reclassification of 
both, the reserve for cash flow hedges and the reserve for cost of hedging, affect the line item in which the hedged item is 
included. The ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
The Group currently does not use fair value hedges. 
RECEIVABLES FROM FI NA NCE LEASES 
Where a Group company is the lessor – generally of vehicles – a receivable in the amount of the net investment in the lease is 
recognized in the case of finance leases, i.e. where substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred to the lessee. 
I NCOME TAXES 
Tax provisions contain obligations resulting from current taxes. Deferred taxes are presented in separate items of the 
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement. Provisions are recognized for potential tax risks based on the 
best estimate of the liability. They also contain amounts for interest on taxes owed and any surcharges that are expected to 
lead to a future liability. 

21 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, for tax credits, and for tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred taxes 
are measured using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized in the amount of the expected tax liability or tax benefit, as appropriate, in 
subsequent fiscal years, based on the expected enacted tax rate at the time of realization. The tax consequences of dividend 
payments are generally not taken into account until the resolution on appropriation of earnings available for distribution has 
been adopted. 
Deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized within a clearly predictable period are reduced by valuation allowances. 
Deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards are usually measured based on future taxable income over a planning period of 
five fiscal years. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and relate to the 
same tax period. 
Changes in deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheet generally result in deferred tax income or expense. If the change 
in deferred taxes results from items recognized in other comprehensive income, the change in deferred taxes is also 
recognized in other comprehensive income. 
I NVENTORI ES 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost comprises directly attributable production costs 
and proportionate fixed and variable production overheads. Overheads are mainly allocated based on the normal capacity of 
the production facilities. Borrowing costs are not capitalized. Selling expenses, general and administrative expenses are not 
included in the cost of inventories. The measurement of same or similar inventories is generally based on the weighted 
average cost method.  
NONCU RRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTI NU ED OPERATIONS  
Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations include both individual noncurrent assets and groups of assets, 
together with liabilities directly associated with those assets (disposal groups), if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.  
Noncurrent assets classified as held for sale, either individually or as part of a disposal group, are presented in separate line 
items in the consolidated balance sheet. To the extent that they are in the measurement scope of IFRS 5 they are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated or amortized. If there is any 
subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, a remeasurement gain is recognized. The remeasurement gain may not 
exceed the cumulative impairment losses already recognized for that asset. 
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that represents a major line of business of the TRATON GROUP and that 
is classified as held for sale or has been disposed of. The assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation are classified as held 
for sale in the consolidated balance sheet until the disposal is completed, and are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell. Gains or losses recognized on measurement to fair value less costs to sell, gains or 
losses on the disposal, and the post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation are presented separately in the 
consolidated income statement as “Result from discontinued operations, net of tax”. Prior-period amounts in the consolidated 
income statement are adjusted accordingly. Discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of cash flows. 
In these cases, too, prior period amounts are adjusted accordingly.  
The elimination of intercompany transactions between TRATON and discontinued operations is based on the post-disposal 
arrangement situation. Where TRATON expects the arrangement to be continued post-disposal, the elimination is made 
against the discontinued operation. Reversely, if the arrangement will not be continued post-disposal the elimination is made 
against the continuing operation. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements outside note “Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations” 
generally relate to continuing operations, unless explicitly stated or otherwise required by IFRSs.  
PENSION PROVISIONS 
The actuarial valuation of pension provisions is based on the projected unit credit method stipulated by IAS 19 for defined 
benefit plans under which the future defined benefit obligation is measured based on the proportionate benefit entitlements 

22 
 
earned by the end of the reporting period and discounted to its present value. The valuation is not only based on pension 
payments and vested entitlements known at the consolidated balance sheet date, but also reflects future salary and pension 
trends, as well as experience-based staff turnover rates. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability comprise 
actuarial gains and losses resulting from differences between the actuarial assumptions made and what has actually occurred, 
or changes in actuarial assumptions, as well as the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest income or 
expense. Remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
At the year-end 2018 the remuneration system in place within the Power Engineering business was modified to include a 
performance share plan with a term of three years (share-based payment). At the time the plan is granted the annual target 
amount under the plan is converted, on the basis of the initial reference price of Volkswagen’s preferred shares, into 
performance shares of Volkswagen AG, which are allocated to the respective participant solely as a calculation figure. At the 
end of the three-year term of the performance share plan, a cash settlement takes place. The payment corresponds to the 
number of determined performance shares, multiplied with the closing reference price at the end of the three-year period plus 
a dividend equivalent for the relevant term. The payment under the performance share plan is limited to 200% of the target 
amount.  
With the sale of the Power Engineering business as of December 31, 2018 (see note “Noncurrent assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations”), this remuneration system is no longer applied in the TRATON GROUP. The performance share plan 
had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of TRATON GROUP. 
An obligation arises from a share-based payment arrangement when TRATON and the participant have a shared 
understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. If that arrangement is subject to an approval process, grant 
date is the date when that approval is obtained. The obligations arising from the share-based payment are accounted for as 
cash-settled plans in accordance with IFRS 2. The cash-settled share based payments are measured at fair value until maturity. 
Fair value is determined using a recognized valuation technique. The compensation cost representing personnel expense is 
allocated over the vesting period. 
OTHER PROVISIONS 
In accordance with IAS 37, provisions are recognized where a present obligation exists to third parties because of a past event, 
where a future outflow of resources is probable and where a reliable estimate of that outflow can be made. 
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is recognized at its present value. Discounting is based 
on market interest rates. The settlement value also reflects cost increases expected at the balance sheet date. 
Provisions are not offset against claims for reimbursement. 
CONTI NGENCI ES AND CO MMITME NTS 
If the criteria for recognizing a provision are not met, but the outflow of financial resources is not improbable, or the amount 
cannot be measured reliably, such obligations are disclosed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements (see the 
“Contingent liabilities” section). Contingent liabilities are only recognized as a provision if the obligations are more certain, i.e. 
the outflow of financial resources has become probable and their amount can be reliably estimated. 
REVENU E FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 
Revenue is recognized once a performance obligation in a contract with a customer is satisfied. Discounts, customer rebates, 
and other sales allowances are deducted from the transaction price. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, 
the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction 
price to the extent that it is highly probable that a reversal of revenue will not occur. 
Revenue from goods is recognized at the point in time when control over the product is transferred to the customer, which is 
normally the date of delivery of the vehicle.  
Revenue from service contracts is recognized when the service has been rendered. In the case of long-term contracts for 
services, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract or, if services are not rendered on a 
straight-line basis, based on the stage of completion using the cost-to-cost method.  

23 
 
Warranties which assure that the sold product complies with agreed upon specifications are accounted for as a provision. 
Extended warranties which customers can purchase separately are accounted for as separate performance obligations. 
Revenue from extended warranties is recognized over the term of the warranty. 
Any unconditional rights to consideration are presented in Other financial assets with a corresponding contract liability. 
TRATON takes the practical expedient to only account for significant financing components for contracts where TRATON 
expects that the period between transferring a good or service and the customer paying for it is more than one year. 
REVENU E FROM LEASE S, BUYBACK AGREE MENTS AN D FI NANCI NG ARRANGEME NTS 
Sales revenue from financing arrangements and finance lease agreements is recognized using the effective interest method 
over the contract term. If non-interest-bearing or low-interest vehicle financing arrangements are agreed, sales revenue is 
reduced by the interest benefits granted. 
In case of operating leases and short-term rentals of vehicles, revenue is allocated on a straight-line basis over the lease or 
rental period. Leases and rentals mainly involve new trucks and buses. The asset remains on the consolidated balance sheet as 
a lease asset. 
Income from sale transactions in which a Group company incurs a buyback obligation at a predetermined value is not 
immediately recognized in full as revenue when control does not transfer to the customer. The difference between the selling 
price and the present value of the buyback price is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the period until the 
return of the item sold. Prior to that time, the assets are carried as lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
OPERATI NG I NCOME AN D EXPENSES 
Operating expenses are recognized when the underlying products or services are utilized. Advertising expenses and other 
sales-related expenses are recognized when incurred. 
Cost of sales includes the production costs incurred to generate the sales revenue and the cost of goods purchased for resale. In 
addition to direct material and labor costs, production cost also includes production-related indirect costs, including 
depreciation of production facilities. This item also includes the costs of additions to warranty provisions for statutory and 
contractual guarantee obligations which are recognized when the products are sold. Research and development costs not 
eligible for capitalization in the period and amortization of development costs are likewise carried under cost of sales. 
Reflecting the presentation of interest and commission income in sales revenue, the interest and commission expenses 
attributable to the financial services business are presented in cost of sales.  
Government grants for expenses incurred are recognized in other operating income for the period or in the item in which the 
expenses to be offset are also recognized. 
 
GOVERNME NT GRA NTS 
Government grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss 
over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense. If the Group becomes entitled to a grant subsequently, 
the amount of the grant attributable to prior periods is recognized in profit or loss. 
ESTIMATES AN D J U DGE MENTS BY MANAGE MENT  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and exercise judgement 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of the 
reporting period. Estimates and judgements relate largely to the following matters:  
The impairment testing of nonfinancial assets, especially goodwill, brand names, capitalized development costs and special 
tools and equity-accounted investments, or investments accounted at cost requires assumptions about future market trends 
as well as about the discount rate to be applied. The expected future market trends lead to detailed planning of the sales of 
commercial vehicles, the profitability of the products and the developments in the after-sales business. The planning period 
for the impairment test generally covers five years, in the case of finite-lived assets it may also depend on the lifetime of the 
item. Estimation of cash flows is generally based on the expected growth trends for the markets concerned which is primarily 
reflected in planned sales revenue and the gross margin of TRATON’s products and services. The estimates for the cash flows 
following the end of the planning period are generally based on a growth rate of up to 1% p.a. (December 31, 2017: up to 1% 
p.a., December 31, 2016: up to 1% p.a.). 

24 
 
Estimates of the useful life of finite-lived assets are based on experience and are reviewed regularly. Where estimates are 
modified, the residual useful life is adjusted and an impairment loss is recognized, if necessary. In addition, the recoverability 
of the Group’s lease assets depends in particular on the residual value of the leased vehicles after expiration of the lease term, 
because this represents a significant portion of the expected cash flows. The forecast of residual values requires management 
to make assumptions in particular about vehicle supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price trends. Such 
assumptions are based either on qualified estimates or on data published by external experts. Qualified estimates are based on 
external data – if available – that reflects additional information that is available internally, such as historical experience and 
current sales data.  
If there are no observable market inputs, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured using recognized valuation techniques, such as the relief-from-royalty method or the residual method. 
The TRATON GROUP has an exposure in the form of contractual payments. In all essential respects, the Group has collateral in 
the form of the right to repossess the underlying vehicle. In case the market value of the collateral does not cover the exposure 
to the customer, and the customer has a problem completing its contractual payments, the Group has a risk of loss. 
Consequently, impairment testing of financial assets requires estimates about the extent and probability of occurrence of 
future events. As far as possible, estimates are derived from experience taking into account current market data as well as 
rating categories and scoring information.  
Accounting for provisions is also based on estimates of the extent and probability of occurrence of future events, as well as 
estimates of the discount rate. As far as possible, these are also based on experience or external opinions. The assumptions 
applied in the measurement of pension provisions are described in the “Provisions for pensions and other post-employment 
benefits” section. Remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income and do not affect profit or loss reported in 
the consolidated income statement. Any change in the estimates of the amount of other provisions is always recognized in 
profit or loss. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information obtained. The use of expected values means that 
additional amounts must frequently be recognized for provisions, or that unused provisions are reversed. Reversals of 
provisions and expenses relating to the recognition of provisions are allocated directly to the functions. Warranty claims from 
sales transactions are calculated based on estimated future costs and the policy on ex gratia arrangements. This requires 
assumptions to be made about the nature and extent of future warranty and ex gratia claims. The measurement of 
restructuring provisions is based on estimates and assumptions regarding the amount of severance payments, the effects of 
onerous contracts, the timeline for the implementation of measures, and consequently, the timing of the expected payments. 
The measurement assumptions are regularly reviewed as the restructuring program progresses. At the same time, litigation 
and other legal proceedings raise complex legal issues and entail numerous difficulties and uncertainties. A provision is 
recognized for these if it is probable that an obligation has arisen in connection with these proceedings that is likely to lead to 
a future outflow of resources and its amount can be estimated reliably.  
Because the Group operates in many countries, it is subject to a variety of tax laws in a large number of jurisdictions. The 
expected current income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities must be determined for each tax entity. Among other 
things, this requires assumptions about the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the ability to generate sufficient 
taxable income, depending on the tax type and tax jurisdiction involved. Any variance between these assumptions and the 
actual outcome of such tax uncertainties may affect tax expense and deferred taxes. Uncertain recognized income tax items 
are based on a best estimate of the probable tax payment. Measuring deferred tax assets requires assumptions regarding 
future taxable income and the timing of the realization of deferred tax assets.  
Estimates and judgement are based on underlying assumptions that reflect the current state of available knowledge. All 
estimates and assumptions represent the best of management’s knowledge and belief in order to convey a true and fair view of 
the Group’s net assets, financial position, and results of operations. Specifically, the expected future development of business 
was based on the circumstances known at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and a realistic 
assessment of the future development of the general economic environment, the relevant markets and the legal environment. 
Our estimates and assumptions remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty because future business developments are 
subject to uncertainties that in part cannot be influenced by the Group.  
Developments in this environment that differ from the assumptions and that cannot be influenced by management could 
result in amounts that differ significantly from the original estimates. If actual developments differ from the expected 
developments, the underlying assumptions and the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected are adjusted.

Global gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 3.7% in 2018 (2017: 3.2%; 2016: 2.5%). In the medium and heavy trucks markets 
relevant for TRATON we expect a slight increase in new registrations of trucks in 2019. For the years 2020 to 2023 we expect a 
robust increase in demand. We expect the Western European market, including the German market, to contract slightly. We 
anticipate a moderate increase demand than in the previous year in Central and Eastern Europe. In Russia, we expect a strong 
recovery in demand in 2019. Demand in South America is expected to be noticeably higher year-on-year.  
Demand in the bus markets relevant to TRATON GROUP should be slightly higher in 2019 than in 2018. We anticipate a 
moderate increase in demand compared to the previous year in Western Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, we expect 
demand to be slightly down on the 2018 figure in 2019. New registrations in South America should moderately increase year-
on-year. 
4. Segment reporting 
Segments are identified on the basis of the TRATON GROUP’s internal management and reporting. Each of its operating 
segments is managed by its own board of management. In order to make decisions about the allocation of resources and the 
assessment of performance, the results of these segments are regularly reviewed by the Company’s Executive Board in its role 
as chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”). Segment reporting comprises the following operating segments: MAN Truck & 
Bus, Volkswagen Caminhões & Ônibus, Scania Vehicles and Services as well as Financial Services. For external reporting 
purposes, the reportable segments are as follows: 
Industrial Business: TRATON’s business activities focus on Commercial Vehicles, comprising the operating segments MAN 
Truck & Bus, Volkswagen Caminhões & Ônibus and Scania Vehicles & Services, which encompass the following products: 
trucks, buses and engines, including the services associated with these products. Between the three segments there is a 
collaboration within key areas such as procurement, research and development. The segments are similar in the nature of the 
products and services offered and there is no systematic difference between the customers of the different segments. All 
brands operate in the market of commercial vehicles, which is a very cyclic market strongly dependent on the overall 
economic situation. As such, the operating performance of the three operating segments is on a different level but the 
segments are exposed to a similar operating cycle regarding their long-term financial performance. This is assessed based on 
the development of Return on Sales (RoS) over time. 
Consequently, in line with the accounting policy as set out IFRS 8 to aggregate segments with similar characteristics, TRATON 
chooses for external reporting purposes to aggregate the three operating segments into a single reportable segment referred to 
as “Industrial Business”. The Industrial Business segment also comprises the holding functions of the Group and equity 
investments held by the holding companies, namely Sinotruk and since 2017 Navistar. 
Financial Services provides financing solutions to customers, such as loan financing, lease contracts and insurance solutions. 
The reportable segment Financial Services only consists of Scania Financial Services. For MAN Truck & Bus and Volkswagen 
Caminhões & Ônibus customers, Volkswagen Financial Services AG and its subsidiaries provide similar financing solutions 
outside the TRATON GROUP. 
The segment information presented represents continuing operations. The segment disclosures for the current and the 
comparative periods therefore do not include the corresponding information for discontinued operations, as presented in the 
section “Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations”.  
Operating profit/loss is the earnings measure for assessing a segment’s results of operations. Operating profit/loss is 
calculated as profit/loss before tax and before the financial result. Purchase price allocation for companies acquired is 
allocated directly to the corresponding segments. 
Segment financial information is presented in accordance with the disclosure and measurement policies applied to the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Sales revenues between the segments are transacted on an arm’s length 
basis. Depreciation, amortization, and impairment losses relate to the intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, other 
equity investments, and assets leased out allocated to the individual divisions. Investments in intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment, and investment property are reported net of investments under finance leases. 

26 
 
In the segment reporting, the share of the profits or losses of joint ventures are contained in the share of profits and losses of 
equity-accounted investments in the corresponding segments. 
The other segments consist of activities carried out by VGSG, an entity sold in January 2019 (see note “Noncurrent assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations”), which relate to the sale of used passenger vehicles and by definition do not constitute a 
reportable segment. The reconciliation contains the consolidation adjustments between the reporting segments.

DISPOSAL OF POWER ENGI NEERI NG BUSI N ESS 
On October 25, 2018, the Group announced its intention to sell the Power Engineering (“PE”) business to a Volkswagen AG 
subsidiary outside the TRATON GROUP for cash consideration determined based on the net assets measured at book values of 
the Power Engineering business. The Power Engineering business consists of the two former operating segments MAN Energy 
Solutions and Renk and the HABAMO Verwaltung GmbH & Co. Objekt Sterkrade KG.  
MAN Energy Solutions is a global leader in large marine diesel engines and stationary engines and is also one of the leading 
suppliers of turbomachinery on the global market. Renk is a globally recognized manufacturer of high-quality special gear 
units, propulsion components, and testing systems. The transaction was completed on December 31, 2018. On this date 
control over the Power Engineering business passed to the acquirer. 
The proceeds of sale equal the carrying amount of the related net assets and, accordingly, no impairment losses were 
recognized on the reclassification of these operations as held for sale. 
ANALYSIS OF PROFIT FOR THE YEA R FROM DISCONTI NU ED OPERATIONS 
The combined results of the operations classified as discontinued in the current year that are included in the profit for the year 
are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and are set out below (including comparative figures). In the 
consolidated balance sheet the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations are not included, as the classification as held 
for sale occurred in October 2018 and the sale of the Power Engineering business took place on December 31, 2018. The 
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and January 1, 2016 include the assets and liabilities of the Power 
Engineering business.

Taking into account non-controlling interests, reclassifications of previously unrealized gains and losses in equity of €36 
million and income tax expenses on the gain of €89 million, the sale of the Power Engineering business for a consideration of 
€1,980 million resulted in a gain on the sale of €48 million. The purchase price was not settled in 2018.

With the sale of Power Engineering cash and cash equivalents of €862 million were disposed of. This includes a cash-pooling

receivables of €525 million arose in TRATON as a result from the deconsolidation, with an impact on the cash flow from 
investing activities of TRATON. 
DISPOSAL OF VOLKSWAGEN GE BRAUCHTFAHRZEUGHA NDELS U ND SERVICE GMBH ( VGSG)  
On December 6, 2018 TRATON AG concluded an agreement with a Volkswagen AG subsidiary outside of the TRATON GROUP to 
sell its subsidiary, VGSG, with effect from January 1, 2019. The Volkswagen Gebrauchtfahrzeughandels und Service GmbH was 
expected to be sold within 12 months and therefore the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale and 
presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Reclassification of VGSG as held for sale 
resulted in the recognition of impairment losses of €6 million.

property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and are included in the cost of sales. In total, cash consideration received 
amounted to €11 million and cash and cash equivalents of €27 million were disposed of.

1 Sales revenue not in the scope of IFRS 15.  

32 
 
Other sales revenue comprises revenue from licenses, among other things. Sales revenue from used vehicles included in 
“Others” relates to the VGSG which was disposed of after the balance sheet date (see note “Noncurrent assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations”). 
Sales revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance (note “Other liabilities”) at 
the beginning of the period totalled €658 million (€542 million in 2017, €424 million in 2016).  
Sales revenue of €26 million recognized in the reporting period (€18 million in 2017, €1 million in 2016) stems from 
performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. This mainly relates to the reversal of provisions for sales allowances. 
REVENU E FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 
 
a) 
I NFORMATION ABOUT THE GROU P ’S PERFORMANCE O BLIGATIONS 
The performance obligations of the Group primarily comprise the sale of trucks, heavy-duty special-purpose vehicles, buses 
and coaches, related genuine parts, as well as the provision of repair and maintenance services. Besides regular legal 
warranties, the Group also grants service-type warranties. 
Performance obligations relating to the transfer of goods are satisfied when the customer obtains control over these goods. 
This is normally the case when the goods have been delivered to the customer and the customer has approved the vehicle. 
Common business practice is for payment terms to be 30 days. In some markets, payments terms up to 140 days are granted. 
Contracts do not contain significant financing components. Customers can decide to finance a vehicle using financing 
solutions offered by TRATON’s Financial Services or with a Volkswagen Group affiliate (e.g. Volkswagen Financial Services). 
When a party outside the TRATON GROUP is used, the Group receives the payment from that party shortly after the customer 
obtains the vehicle.  
Performance obligations relating to service contracts and service-type warranties are satisfied over the contract term. In case 
of prepayments received, the transaction price allocated to these services is recognized as a contract liability at the time of the 
initial sales transaction and is released over the period of service. Where the payment of service fees parallels the services 
rendered, sales revenue recognized corresponds to the fees paid. 
In the case of contracts, in which service elements have an insignificant value as compared to the revenue from the sale of the 
vehicle, the residual approach is used for the transaction price allocation. This does not result in material differences compared 
to revenue recognized based on relative stand-alone selling prices. In other cases, the transaction price is allocated based on 
the relative stand-alone selling prices. 
B) 
TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO THE REMAI NI NG PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS 
The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially 
unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and the expected timing of revenue recognition were as follows:

The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for which revenue recognition is expected within a year 
primarily relates to the delivery of vehicles. An expected revenue recognition in more than one year mainly stems from long-
term service and extended warranty contracts.

REVENU E FROM FI NANCI NG ARRA NGE MENTS 
TRATON’s Financial Services business offers various forms of financing solutions ordinarily with maturities between three 
until five years, with the vehicle as underlying collateral. Market conditions as well as civil law and tax rules in each country 
often determine what financing solution is offered. Financing consists mainly of financial leases, in which the right of 
ownership of the vehicle remains with TRATON during the lease term, but material risks and rewards have been transferred to 
the lessee. If hire purchase contracts are offered, the right of ownership is transferred to the customer on the date of sale, but 
Financial Services receives collateral in the form of a lien on the vehicle. If Financial Services offers a lease when delivering 
vehicles for which substantial risks remain with TRATON, primarily attributable to guaranteed residual values, the contract is 
recognized as an operating lease. 
7. Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes nonstaff overheads and personnel costs, as well as depreciation and amortization attributable to the 
production function. It also includes expenses of €489 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €469 
million, December 31, 2016: €482 million) attributable to the Financial Services business. 
8. Administrative expenses 
The administrative expenses mainly include nonstaff overheads and personnel costs, as well as depreciation and amortization 
applicable to the administrative functions. The increase in 2018 relates, amongst other, to costs in relation with the 
preparation of capital market readiness amounting to €68 million.

the closing rate for such items. Foreign exchange losses from these items are included in other operating expenses. 
Government grants related to income amounted to €7 million in 2018, €16 million in 2017 and €14 million in 2016 and were 
generally allocated to the functions. 
Miscellaneous other operating income in 2018 includes income from reversal of liabilities related to social security

The statutory corporation tax rate in Germany for the 2018 assessment period was 15%. Including trade tax and the solidarity 
surcharge, this resulted in an aggregate tax rate of 29.9% (December 31, 2017: 29.9%, December 31, 2016: 29.9%).  
A tax rate of 29.8% for December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: 29.9%, December 31, 2016: 29.9%) was used to measure deferred 
taxes in the German consolidated tax group with Volkswagen AG. The decrease results from the termination of the 
domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with MAN SE with effect from January 1, 2019.  
The local income tax rates applied for companies outside Germany vary between 0% and 45%. In the case of split tax rates, the 
tax rate applicable to undistributed profits is applied. 
The realization of tax benefits from tax loss carryforwards from previous years resulted in a reduction in current income taxes 
to €6 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €10 million, December 31, 2016: €9 million). 
Previously unrecognized tax losses and tax credits used to reduce deferred tax expense amounted to €37 million as of 
December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €7 million, December 31, 2016: €4 million).

Deferred taxes are not recognized on retained profits of €24.7 billion (December 31, 2017: €12.1 billion, December 31, 2016: 
€11.5 billion, January 1, 2016: €11.2 billion) of foreign subsidiaries, as it is largely intended to reinvest these profits in the 
operations of the relevant companies. Generally, the distribution would lead to an additional income tax expense. It is not 
practicable to estimate the aggregate amount of the underlying taxable temporary differences for these undistributed foreign 
earnings. 
Deferred tax expense/income (+/-) resulting from changes in tax rates amounted to €-20 million as of December 31, 2018 
(December 31, 2017: €-4 million, December 31, 2016: €4 million) at Group level. 
Deferred taxes in respect of temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards of €18 million as of December 31, 2018 
(December 31, 2017: €38 million, December 31, 2016: €174 million, January 1, 2016: €95 million) were recognized without 
being offset by deferred tax liabilities in the same amount. The deferred tax assets of companies within the German tax group 
were recognized due to positive results in the past and are included in this analysis. The companies affected are expecting 
positive tax income in the future, following losses in the reporting period or the previous year. 
€10 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €-13 million, December 31, 2016: €86 million) of the deferred taxes 
recognized in the consolidated balance sheet was credited to equity and relates to other comprehensive income. Changes in 
deferred taxes classified by balance sheet item are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Earnings per share are calculated by dividing consolidated earnings after tax from continuing operations attributable to 
TRATON SE shareholders by the average number of shares outstanding in the year. Since TRATON’s change of legal form from a 
limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH) to a public company (Aktiengesellschaft) took effect 
on June 26, 2018 (the change in legal form to a SE took effect on January 17, 2019), the calculation of the number of shares was 
based on the nominal amount of subscribed capital of EUR 10,000,200. 
The computation of diluted earnings per share is identical to that of basic earnings per share because TRATON SE has not 
issued any financial instruments that could result in dilutive effects.

Other intangible assets comprise in particular licenses, software, similar rights and customer relationships. Purchased licenses, 
software, similar rights and assets, and capitalized development costs are finite-lived assets. Amortization and impairment 
losses are included in the functional expenses, in particular cost of sales and selling expenses.  
In the third quarter of 2018 the restructuring of MAN Truck & Bus India was initiated and executed in the fourth quarter of 
2018. In connection with the sale of assets allocated to that subsidiary, the relating intangible assets, in particular acquired 
customer bases, were fully impaired. The related impairment costs of €10 million were included in the cost of sales. 
The allocation of the brand names and goodwill to the operating segments is shown in the following table:

Goodwill and brand names are tested for impairment at least once a year by comparing the carrying amounts of the units to 
which goodwill is allocated with their value in use. Value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method. 
Impairment testing is based on the current five-year planning for the division concerned. The value of the recognized goodwill 
is not impaired even if the growth forecast for the perpetuity or the discount rate varies by -/+ 0.5 percentage points.

Investment property consists of land and buildings held for rental and/or capital appreciation with a fair value of €46 million 
as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €47 million, December 31, 2016: €56 million, January 1, 2016: €52 million). 
Rental income from investment property amounted €3 million in the reporting period (€6 million in 2017, €5 million in 
2016). No valuation by an independent valuer was carried out. Generally, fair value is calculated using an income capitalization 
approach based on internal calculations (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy). Amortization and impairment losses are included 
in the functional expenses, in particular cost of sales and selling expenses. 
In the third quarter of 2018 the restructuring of MAN Truck & Bus India was initiated and executed in the fourth quarter 2018. 
In connection with the sale of assets allocated to that subsidiary related property, plant and equipment, in particular acquired 
property, technical equipment and machinery as well as specialised tools and devices were fully impaired. The related 
impairment costs of €20 million were included in the cost of sales. Additionally €15 million impairment costs relate to the 
closure of Scania’s bus operations in India.

18. Equity-accounted investments and other equity investments 
From a Group perspective, the associates Sinotruk (Hong Kong, China) Ltd. and Navistar International Corporation (Lisle, USA) 
were material at the reporting date. 
SI NOTRU K 
Sinotruk is one of the largest truck manufacturers in the Chinese market. There is an agreement in place between Group 
companies and Sinotruk regarding a long-term strategic partnership, under which the Group participates in the local market. 
In addition to the partnership with Sinotruk in the volume segment, exports of MAN vehicles to China are also helping to 
expand access to the small, but fast-growing premium truck market. Sinotruk’s principal place of business is in Hong Kong, 
China. 
In previous years TRATON GROUP recognized impairment losses from the investment in Sinotruk, as the recoverable amount 
was lower than the carrying amount due to negative cash flow forecasts and a decline in business. This impairment was 
reversed as of June 30, 2018 as Sinotruk’s business situation recovered. The reversal in 2018 amounts to €190 million and was 
recognized in other financial result (see note “Other Financial Result”). 

47 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the quoted market price of the shares in Sinotruk amounted to €908 million (December 31, 2017: 
€648 million, December 31, 2016: €466 million, January 1, 2016: €251 million).

Receivables from finance leases relate to commercial vehicle leases. The gross investment in the lease is the aggregate of the 
future lease payments receivable until expiration of the lease. The present value is obtained by discounting the gross 
investment in the lease at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The receivables from finance leases were or are expected to 
generate the following cash flows as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016:

The largest share of the cash pooling balance relates to cash retained for payouts from valuation proceedings 
(“Spruchverfahren”) for minority shareholders of MAN SE. A small amount relates to regular transactions from the operative 
business of TRATON. In 2018, the cash pooling balance decreased by €2,132 million as a result of the purchase of MAN SE 
shares tendered to the Company (see section Litigation). 
The cash pooling includes short term cash equivalents due from Power Engineering companies. In accordance with the 
purchase contract Volkswagen AG guarantees the reimbursement of these receivables. 

54 
 
26. Equity 
The subscribed capital of TRATON SE is composed of 10,000,200 no-par value bearer shares with a nominal value of €1 per 
share. The subscribed capital of €10,000,200 is fully paid-in. All shares were subscribed by Volkswagen AG. Before the change of 
the legal form to a public company on June 14, 2018 subscribed capital composed ownership of the parent company in 
TRATON SE. 
Capital reserves of €21,331 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €24,581 million, December 31, 2016: €24,271 
million, January 1, 2016: €24,271 million) represent contributions of Volkswagen AG in TRATON SE, in particular relating to 
the contributions in kind of MAN SE (increasing the capital reserve by €9,058 million) and Scania AB (increasing the capital 
reserve by €11,952 million). During 2017, capital reserves were increased through a cash contribution by Volkswagen AG in the 
total amount of €311 million. In 2018 the management converted parts of the capital reserves into retained earnings for an 
intended distribution back to Volkswagen AG amounting to €3,250 million. The distribution was not yet approved as per  
December 31, 2018 and as such, no liability was recognized. 
Retained earnings of €-2,064 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €-10,760 million, December 31, 2016: €-
11,817 million, January 1, 2016: €-12,059 million) represent amounts that were recorded as earnings after tax in previous 
periods. They also include the difference between the value of the MAN SE shares at which they were contributed to TRATON 
SE and the recognized book value of corresponding assets and liabilities. This difference amounted to €2,963 million as of 
January 1, 2016. The accumulated other comprehensive income of €-2,478 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 
2017: €-2,130 million, December 31, 2016: €-1,635 million, January 1, 2016: €-1,466 million) includes the cumulative amounts 
of transactions recorded in other comprehensive income, in particular, exchange differences on translating foreign operations 
and pension plan remeasurements. For further information, see the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Other changes of €157 million in the pension plan reserve in 2018 relate to a change in presentation following the 
deconsolidation of the Power Engineering business.  
In accordance with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement between Volkswagen AG and TRATON SE, TRATON 
SE will transfer its annual result (as determined under German statutory accounting rules and subject to certain limitations 
within German commercial law) to Volkswagen AG and accordingly, does not distribute dividends.  
NONCONTROLLI NG I NTERESTS 
The noncontrolling interests in 2016 and 2017 are mainly attributable to Renk Aktiengesellschaft, Augsburg, in which 
TRATON, through its subsidiary MAN SE, held a 76% interest until December 31, 2018. The following table presents 
summarized financial information for Renk. For 2018, no information is presented as Renk Aktiengesellschaft as part of the 
Power Engineering business was sold as per December 31, 2018 (see note “Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations”). As a result of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement concluded between MAN SE and TRATON SE 
in June 2013, noncontrolling interest shareholders of MAN SE are entitled to a cash settlement or a cash compensation in 
accordance with German law. Their shares are not part of equity, they are presented in “Put Options and Compensation Rights 
Granted to Noncontrolling Interest Shareholders” instead. The domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with MAN 
SE was terminated with effect from January 1, 2019.

Financial liabilities from bonds mainly relate to European Medium Term Notes (EMTN). The increase in bonds in 2018 relates 
to the growth of financing activities, carried out by the Financial Services business.  
Loans and other liabilities include loans from Volkswagen AG of €2,293 million (December 31, 2017: €2,255 million, December 
31, 2016: €1,877 million, January 1, 2016: €400 million). The increase in loans and other liabilities in 2018 mainly relates to 
liabilities towards the Power Engineering business of €759 million following deconsolidation as of December 31, 2018. The 
liabilities related to the Power Engineering business remain generally as liabilities in the normal course of the business of 
these entities. 

56 
 
TRATON’s credit facilities include customary Change of Control clauses, which means that the counterparty could demand 
early payment in case of significant changes in ownership involving a change in control of the company.

The liabilities from buyback obligations result from repurchase obligations of sold commercial vehicles accounted for as 
operating leases because of a buyback agreement. 
Other financial liabilities include the negative fair value of derivatives. Because these instruments are predominantly used to 
hedge currency risks in customer orders, they are matched in this respect by offsetting effects from the underlying.  
The dividends payable were decided in an Extraordinary General Meeting of Scania AB in December 2015. They were paid out 
to the former shareholder, Volkswagen AG, in 2016.

30. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Provisions for pensions are recognized for commitments in the form of retirement, invalidity, dependents and other benefits 
payable under pension plans. The benefits provided by the Group vary according to the legal, tax and economic circumstances 
of the country concerned, and usually depend on the length of service and remuneration of the employees. 
TRATON GROUP companies provide occupational pensions under both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. In the 
case of defined contribution plans, companies contribute to state or private pension schemes based on legal or contractual 
requirements, or on a voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no further obligations for the TRATON 
GROUP. Current contributions are recognized as pension expenses of the period concerned. They amounted to a total of €276 
million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €257 million, December 31, 2016: €238 million) in the TRATON GROUP. 
In the case of defined benefit plans, a distinction is made between unfunded pensions and plans funded by external assets.  
The pension provisions for defined benefits are measured by independent actuaries using the internationally accepted 
projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19, under which the future obligations are measured based on the ratable 

58 
 
benefit entitlements earned as of the balance sheet date. Measurement reflects actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, 
salary and pension trends, employee turnover rates, longevity and increases in healthcare costs, which were determined for 
each Group company depending on the economic environment. Remeasurements arise from differences between what has 
actually occurred and the prior-year assumptions as well as from changes in assumptions. They are recognized in other 
comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, in the period in which they arise. 
Significant Pension Arrangements in the TRATON GROUP  
For the period after their active working life, the TRATON GROUP offers its employees benefits under attractive, modern 
occupational pension arrangements. Most of the arrangements in the TRATON GROUP classify as defined benefit plans under 
IAS 19. To reduce the risks associated with defined benefit plans, in particular longevity, salary increases and inflation, the 
TRATON GROUP makes use of defined benefit plans whose benefits are funded by appropriate external plan assets. The above-
mentioned risks have been largely reduced in these pension plans. The significant pension plans are described in the 
following. 
SCANIA’S U N FU NDED SWEDISH PE NSION PLANS 
Scania’s employees in Sweden are covered through post-employment benefit plans that offer benefits in the form of 
retirement pensions, early retirement pensions, dependent’s protection, health care and severance pay. Depending on their 
function and age, employees are eligible to enroll in either the SAF/LO defined-contribution plan or the ITP plan, both of which 
are multi-employer plans based on collective agreements.  
The ITP plan has two parts, ITP1, which is a defined-contribution plan applying to employees born in 1979 or later, and ITP2, a 
defined-benefit plan applying to employees born before 1979. Most of the ITP2 plan is funded solely through recognized 
provisions, safeguarded through credit insurance from the mutual insurance company Försäkringsbolaget PRI 
Pensionsgaranti, which also administers the plan.  
Asides from these obligations, there are early retirement defined-benefit obligations for workers who at the age of 62 have 
worked for 30 years or who at the age of 63 have worked for 25 years in the company, as well as to a limited number of persons 
in managerial positions. 
As the obligations are funded solely through recognized provisions, the company bears the risks arising from changes in the 
longevity of plan participants as well as from changes in interest rate risk, as the present value of the guaranteed obligation 
rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk.  
MAN’S GERMAN PENSION PLANS FU NDED BY EXTERNAL PLAN ASSET S 
Once their active working life is over, the MAN Group grants its employees in Germany benefits provided by a modern, 
attractive occupational pension system that constitute a key element of its remuneration policy. Occupational pensions 
provide reliable additional retirement benefits as well as risk protection in the event of invalidity or death. 
Under MAN’s current pension plans, all active employees receive employer contributions that are tied to their remuneration 
and can also make additional provision through deferred compensation — which is employer-subsidized for staff subject to 
collective bargaining agreements. The employer- and employee-funded contributions plus returns on capital market 
investments allow staff to accumulate plan assets during their active employment that are paid out as a lump sum or in 
installments on retirement, or that can be annuitized in certain cases. The risk of the investments is gradually reduced as 
employees get older (lifecycle concept). The performance of the plan assets is based on the return on capital investments. In 
line with the legislative requirements, at a minimum the total amount of contributions paid in for the employee are paid out 
when the employee retires. 
Former employees, pensioners, or employees with vested benefits who have left MAN have benefit commitments from 
discontinued pension plans, most of which are designed to provide lifelong pension payments. These commitments are 
exposed to the standard longevity and inflation risks, which are regularly monitored and assessed. 
MAN’s German pension assets are managed by MAN Pension Trust e.V. and MAN Pensionsfonds AG. These assets are 
irrevocably protected from recourse by the Group companies and may only be used to fund current pension benefit payments 
or to settle claims by employees in the event of insolvency. Proper management and utilization of the trust assets are 
supervised by independent trustees. Additionally, MAN Pensionsfonds AG is regulated by the Bundesanstalt für 
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin — German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority).

The pension assets are invested by professional investment managers in accordance with investment rules laid down by 
MAN’s investment committee. Strategic allocation of the pension assets is based on regular asset/liability management 
studies. The assets attributable to the current pension plans are generally invested with the objective of covering the 
performance risk resulting from the return parameters of the lifecycle concept. 
PENSION PLANS I N OTHER T RATON COU NTRI ES 
Employees in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil receive pension benefits under defined benefit funded pension 
plans. 
MAN´s pension plans in the United Kingdom have been closed and grant lifelong pension benefits plan. Trustee boards, which 
have appointed professional administrators and advisers, are responsible for administering the pension plans, including 
investing the assets. Regular asset/liability management studies form the basis for investment and risk management. The 
investment risk is being successively reduced as part of a defined de-risking strategy as funding ratios improve. 
Scania’s employees at Scania Great Britain (SGB) are covered by a premium-based occupational pension. Both the company 
and employees contribute to the plan. There are defined-benefit plans, which are closed for future accruals since May 31, 2003. 
All plans are administered by trustees who are responsible for ensuring that SGB has sufficient financing to fully meet all 
vested/earned benefits for all members. The normal retirement age in the schemes is 65. 
For Scania’s employees in Switzerland the Pensionskasse and the Wohlfahrtsstiftung are the legal carriers of the pension plans 
and reviewing early retirement pension. Contributions are split between employer and employees for the basic pension plan 
and in the supplementary plan for members of the management. Switzerland recognises the net pension assets in the balance 
sheet and an asset ceiling is thus applied. 
Employees at Scania Latin America Ltda are covered by four post-employment defined-benefit plans. Three health care plans 
cover medical, dental and pharmaceutical expenses as well as the cost of a life insurance plan. The plans are open to personnel 
retiring at a minimum age of 55 with at least 10 years’ service. 
Furthermore, in other countries, there are pension plans with a low level of benefits or mandatory post-employment benefits 
are granted. These benefits are backed in full (Brazil) or in part (Belgium, France, India) by capital, or unfunded (Austria, Turkey, 
Poland). 
There is a general prohibition on acquiring securities issued by companies in the Volkswagen Group. 
MU LTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS 
Multi-employer pension plans exist in the TRATON GROUP in Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. These plans are 
mostly defined benefit plans.  
In the Multiple-employer pension institutions in Switzerland the employees accumulate plan assets in these institutions that 
are then converted into a lifelong annuity at the terms prevailing when the employee reaches pensionable age. The pension 
institutions are managed conservatively based on standards imposed by government. If the plan assets are insufficient to 
meet the pension entitlements because of adverse market developments, the member employers and their employees can be 
required to make “stabilization contributions.”  
A small proportion of Multi-employer pension plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the TRATON GROUP is 
not authorized to receive the information required in order to account for them as defined benefit plans. For the TRATON 
GROUP, this applies to the Dutch pension funds Pensioenfonds Metaal en Techniek and Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds Metal 
Elektro, which are administered via MN Services, as well as the portion of the Swedish ITP occupational pension plan that is 
administered via the retirement insurance company Alecta. In the Dutch plans, both companies and employees contribute to 
the plan. The consolidation level of PMT was 102% (as of December 31, 2018, 102% as of December 31, 2017, 97% as of 
December 31, 2016, 98% as of January 1, 2016) and for PME 101% (as of December 31, 2018, 102% as of December 31, 2017, 96% 
as of December 31, 2016, 98% as of January 1, 2016). At year-end 2018, Alecta’s surplus, in the form of a collective consolidation 
level (assets in relation to the insurance obligation), amounted to 142% in Sweden (as of December 31, 2018, 154% as of 
December 31, 2017, 149% as of December 31, 2016, 153% as of January 1, 2016). If the consolidation level falls below or exceeds 
the normal range (122-155), Alecta shall take measures, for example raise agreed subscription prices and extension of existing 
benefits, or introduce premium reductions. Alecta’s insurance obligation is calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial methods 
and assumptions, which deviate from the methods and assumptions applied in measurement of defined-benefit pensions 
according to IAS 19. No probable significant risks arising from multi-employer defined benefit pension plans that are 

60 
 
accounted for as defined contribution plans have been identified. The expected contributions to those plans will amount to 
€10 million for fiscal year 2019. Under the terms of the multi-employer plans, the TRATON GROUP has a very limited liability 
for the obligations of the other employers. In the event of its withdrawal from the plans or their winding-up, the proportionate 
share of the surplus of assets attributable to the TRATON GROUP will be credited or the proportionate share of the deficit 
attributable to the TRATON GROUP will have to be funded. In the case of the defined benefit plans accounted for as defined 
contribution plans, the TRATON GROUP’s share of the obligations represents a small proportion of the total obligations.  
The following amounts were recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for defined benefit plans:

These assumptions are averages that were weighted using the present value of the defined benefit obligation. With regard to 
life expectancy, consideration is given to the latest mortality tables in each country. The discount rates are generally defined to 
reflect the yields on highly rated corporate bonds with matching maturities and currencies. The payroll trends cover expected 
wage and salary trends, which also include increases attributable to career development. The pension trends either reflect the 
contractually guaranteed pension adjustments or are based on the rules on pension adjustments in force in each country. The 
employee turnover rates are based on past experience and future expectations.

For MAN’s pension plans in the United Kingdom in 2018 a past service gain resulted from the implementation of a Bridging 
Pension Option as well as a permanent Pension Increase Exchange Option. 
Reductions from changes in consolidated Group relate to the sale of the Power Engineering business. 
Changes in the relevant actuarial assumptions would have had the following effects on the defined benefit obligation: 
 
 

62 
 
 
The sensitivity analysis shown above considers the change in one assumption at a time, leaving the other assumptions 
unchanged versus the original calculation, i.e. any correlation effects between the individual assumptions are ignored. To 
examine the sensitivity of the present value of the defined benefit obligation to a change in assumed longevity, the age of the 
beneficiaries was reduced by one year as part of a comparative calculation. The average duration of the defined benefit 
obligation weighted by the present value of the defined benefit obligation (Macaulay duration) is 15 years in 2018 (14 years in 
2017 and 14 years in 2016). 
The maturity profile of payments attributable to the defined benefit obligation is presented in the following table, which 
classifies the present value of the obligation by the maturity of the underlying payments:

The obligations arising from sales contain provisions covering all risks relating to the sale of vehicles, components and 
genuine parts. They primarily comprise warranty obligations for statutory and contractual guarantee obligations. The timing 
of settlement of provisions for warranties depends on the occurrence of the warranty claim. They also include provisions for 
discounts, bonuses and similar allowances which are incurred after the balance sheet date, but for which there is a legal or 
constructive obligation attributable to sales revenue before the balance sheet date. 
Provisions for employee expenses are recognized for long-service awards, partial retirement arrangements, severance 
payments and similar obligations, among other things.  
Provisions for litigation and legal risks are largely the result of the antitrust proceedings that the European Commission 
opened in 2011 against European truck manufacturers. Further information and the impact on provisions can be found in the 

66 
 
section entitled “Litigation”. In addition, the provisions for litigation and legal risks contain amounts related to a large number 
of legal disputes and official proceedings in which TRATON GROUP companies become involved in Germany and 
internationally in the course of their operating activities. In particular, such legal disputes and other proceedings may occur in 
relation to suppliers, dealers, customers, and employees. Please refer to the “Litigation” section for a discussion of the legal 
risks. 
Miscellaneous provisions relate to a wide range of identifiable specific risks and uncertain obligations arising from operative 
activities, which are measured in the amount of the expected settlement value. Miscellaneous provisions additionally include 
provisions for restructuring measures amounting to €38 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €123 million, 
December 31, 2016: €309 million, January 1, 2016: €186 million). In 2017, an amount of €91 million of restructuring 
provisions was released, €50 million of which related to MAN Truck & Bus and €41 million to discontinued operations.  
32. Put options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders 
This balance sheet item consists primarily of the present value of the cash settlement in accordance with section 305 of the 
Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) offered to MAN shareholders in connection with the domination and 
profit and loss transfer agreement at €90.29 per share. The decrease in 2018 mainly results from the purchase of shares 
tendered to the Company, which lead to an increase of TRATON’s shareholding in MAN SE from 74.55% to 86.87% by December 
31, 2018. In 2018, cash payments of €2,132 million for compensation rights and the purchase of MAN SE shares tendered to 
TRATON were made. Further information is included in the section “Litigation”.

Net gains and losses from financial assets measured at fair value through OCI primarily comprise dividends from investments.  
Net gains and losses from financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortized cost comprise interest income and 
expenses in accordance with the effective interest method under IFRS 9, including currency translation effects. In addition, net 
gains and losses on financial assets include impairment losses as well as their respective reversals.

RECONCI LIATION OF BALANCE SHE ET ITEMS TO CLASSES OF FI NANCI AL I NSTRUMENTS 
The following table shows the reconciliation of the balance sheet items to the relevant classes of financial instruments, broken 
down by the carrying amount and fair value of the financial instruments.  
The fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost is calculated by discounting using a market rate of interest 
for a similar risk and matching maturity. For reasons of materiality, the fair value of current balance sheet items is generally 
deemed to be their carrying amount.

Measurement and presentation of the fair values of financial instruments are based on a fair value hierarchy that reflects the 
significance of the inputs used for measurement and is classified as follows: 
• 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
 
• 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments in Level 2 is determined based on the 
conditions prevailing at the end of the reporting period, such as interest rates or exchange rates, and using 
recognized models such as discounted cash flow or option pricing models. 
 
• 
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The 
fair value of put options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders is calculated 
using a present value model based on the cash settlement determined by the Munich Regional Court in the 
award proceedings, including cash compensation, as well as the minimum statutory interest rate and a risk-
adjusted discount rate for a matching maturity. For further information, please see the section “Litigation”. The 
fair value of Level 3 receivables was measured by reference to individual expectations of losses; these are based 
to a significant extent on the Company’s assumptions about counterparty credit quality. 

72 
 
FI NANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABI LITI ES MEASU RED AT FAI R VALU E BY LEVEL 
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as well as the derivative financial instruments included in hedging 
relationships are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, except for other equity investments which are classified in 
Level 3. Other equity investments mainly comprise shares in unlisted companies for which there are no quoted market values 
as there is no active market. The fair value of these investments is calculated using discounted cash flow models. Due to the 
small carrying amount of these investments, a change in unobservable inputs would not result in a significantly lower or 
higher measurement of the instruments’ fair value. Further information on these instruments can be found in note “Equity-
accounted investments and other equity investments” in the subsection “Other equity investments”. Dividends for 
investments derecognized in 2018 were received in the amount of €1 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €1 
million, December 31, 2016: €1 million).

The “Financial instruments” column shows the amounts that are subject to a master netting arrangement but were not set off 
because they do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the consolidated balance sheet. The “Collateral received” and “Collateral 
pledged” columns show the amounts of cash collateral and collateral in the form of financial instruments received and 
pledged for the total assets and liabilities that do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Other disclosures 
33. Consolidated cash flow statement 
Cash flows are presented in the consolidated cash flow statement classified into cash flows from operating activities, investing 
activities and financing activities. 
The change in cash and cash equivalents attributable to changes in exchange rates is presented in a separate line item. Cash 
flow from operating activities is reported using the indirect method. Earnings before tax are adjusted to eliminate noncash 
expenditures (mainly depreciation, amortization and impairment losses) and income, as well as gains and losses from asset 
disposals. Other noncash expense/income results mainly from measurement effects in connection with financial instruments 
and from fair value changes relating to derivatives (see section entitled “Other financial result”). This results in cash flows from 
operating activities after accounting for changes in working capital, which also include changes in lease assets and in financial 
services receivables. 
Investing activities include additions to property, plant and equipment and equity investments, additions to capitalized 
development costs and investments in securities and loans. Payments received from these positions are offset. Payments from 
the disposal of subsidiaries are reported net of cash disposed. 
Financing activities include outflows of funds from dividend payments, profit transfers to and loss absorptions by Volkswagen 
AG and repayment of bonds, inflows from capital increases and issuance of bonds, and changes in other financial liabilities.  
Cash and cash equivalents presented in the statement of cash flows include bank balances and highly liquid financial 
investments of a temporary nature that are exposed to no more than minor risks of fluctuation in value. Current account 
overdraft facilities are not presented as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows, but are 
reported in cash flows from financing activities if they are used. 
In 2018, cash flows from operating activities include interest received amounting to €400 million (in 2017: €368 million, in 
2016: €330 million) and interest paid amounting to €275 million (in 2017: €284 million, in 2016: €261 million). Cash flows 
from operating activities also include dividend payments received from joint ventures and associates of €54 million as of 
December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €8 million, December 31, 2016: €4 million). Dividends received from financial 
investments and other equity activities amounted to €0 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €2 million, 
December 31, 2016: €2 million). 

77 
 
Based on the current domination and profit and loss transfer agreement between Volkswagen AG and TRATON SE, the 2017 
loss of €28 million was transferred in 2018 (the 2016 loss of €32 million was transferred in 2017, the 2015 profit of €2,365 
million was transferred in 2016). 
The reconciliation shows the movement in financial liabilities, separated into changes from cash-effective operations and non-
cash changes.

34. Financial risk management and financial instruments 
1. 
HEDGI NG GU I DELI NES A ND FI NANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRI NCI PLES 
Because of the TRATON GROUP’s business activities and international focus, its assets, liabilities, and forecast transactions are 
exposed to market, credit, and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s risk positions are hedged externally with banks within defined risk limits. Subgroups have their own risk 
management structures. MAN’s market risks are reported regularly to the Executive and Supervisory Boards. Compliance with 
the guidelines is reviewed by the Internal Audit function. Scania´s financial risk management is regulated by a Finance Policy 
adopted by Scania’s Board of Directors. Risks are managed primarily at corporate level by Scania’s treasury unit. On a daily 
basis, the corporate treasury unit measures the risks of outstanding positions, which are managed within established limits in 
compliance with the Finance Policy as well as TRATON GROUP Treasury Framework Policy. 
2. 
CREDIT AND DEFAU LT RISK 
The TRATON GROUP is exposed to credit risk because of its business operations and certain financing activities.  
From the Group’s perspective, credit risk entails the risk that a party to a financial instrument will fail to meet its contractual 
obligations and thus cause a financial loss for the Group. Credit risk comprises both the direct default risk and the risk of a 
deterioration in credit quality. Credit risk related to customer commitments is managed, within established limits, on a 
decentralized basis by means of local credit assessments. Decisions on major credit commitments are made in subgroup credit 
committees. 
The maximum credit risk is reflected by the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized in the consolidated balance 
sheet; see note “Additional Financial Instruments Disclosures in accordance with IFRS 7”. The maximum potential credit and 
default risk for trade receivables is reduced by collateral held and other credit enhancements in the amount of €190 million as 
of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €312 million, December 31, 2016: €226 million, January 1, 2016: €232 million), 
which represents the total estimated fair value. Collateral comprises assets transferred as security as well as credit insurance 
and guarantees. Collateral relating to receivables from the financing business mainly exists in the form of the possibility of 
repossessing the financed assets 
The risk arising from nonderivative financial instruments is also accounted for by recognizing bad debt losses. Material 
individual receivables, as well as receivables whose collectability is in doubt, are measured on an item-by-item basis. 
Significant cash and capital investments, as well as derivatives, are only entered into with national and international banks as 
well as with the Group’s ultimate parent, Volkswagen AG. Financial guarantees issued also give rise to credit and default risk. 
The maximum potential credit and default risk is calculated from the amount the TRATON GROUP would have to pay if claims 
were to be asserted under the guarantees. The corresponding amounts are presented in the Liquidity risk section.  
The TRATON GROUP has largely decentralized liquidity management at MAN and Scania. The financial institutions and 
investment forms are carefully selected when investing cash funds, while a limit system ensures diversification. In line with 
the nature of TRATON GROUP’s inclusion in the central financial management of the Volkswagen Group agreed with 
Volkswagen AG, a significant portion of TRATON GROUP’s financial assets is concentrated on a single partner, Volkswagen AG. 
Volkswagen AG’s high credit rating and the risk management mechanisms installed limit the credit risks from the financial 
assets allocated at Volkswagen AG. Other than this, there were no material concentrations of credit risk in the TRATON GROUP.

Credit risk rating grade 1 comprises financial instruments which are considered to be not at risk of default. Rating grade 2 
refers to financial instruments under an intensified loan management. Rating grade 3 comprises impaired financial 
instruments. 
Collateral that was accepted for financial assets in the current fiscal year was recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in 
the amount of €0 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €0 million, December 31, 2016: €12 million, January 1, 
2016: €8 million). This collateral mainly relates to vehicles.

LIQU I DITY RISK 
Liquidity risk describes the risk that the TRATON GROUP will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with 
financial liabilities or that it can only procure liquidity at a higher price. 
To counter this risk, cash inflows and outflows and due dates are continuously monitored and managed. Cash requirements 
are primarily met by our operating business and by external financing arrangements. As a result, there were no material 
concentrations of risk in the past fiscal year. 
The solvency and liquidity of TRATON GROUP are ensured at all times by rolling liquidity planning, a liquidity reserve in the 
form of cash, confirmed credit lines and the issuance of securities on the international money and capital markets. For Scania 
Financial Services, there shall be dedicated funding to cover the estimated funding demands during the next six months. 
There shall also always be borrowings that safeguard the existing portfolio. 

82 
 
There are also committed credit lines with financial institutions as well as with Volkswagen AG. For TRATON GROUP, unused 
credit lines from banks and Volkswagen AG amounting to €4.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €4.6 
billion, December 31, 2016: €5.1 billion, January 1, 2016: €6.2 billion) were available as a liquidity reserve.  
Local cash funds in certain countries (e.g. Brazil, China, India, and South Korea) are only available to the Group for cross-border 
transactions subject to exchange controls. There are no significant restrictions over and above these. 
The following table shows how the cash flows relating to liabilities, derivatives, and contingent liabilities affect the TRATON 
GROUP’s liquidity position:

The following methodology was applied in calculating the amounts:  
- 
If no contractual maturity has been agreed, the liability refers to the earliest maturity date. 
- 
Variable-rate interest payments reflect the conditions at the end of the reporting period. 
- 
It is assumed that the cash outflows will not occur earlier than shown. 
2 
The undiscounted maximum cash flows from buyback obligations are recognized as a financial liability. 
Derivatives comprise both cash flows from derivative financial instruments with negative fair values and cash flows from 
derivatives with positive fair values for which gross settlement has been agreed. Derivatives entered into through offsetting 
transactions are also accounted for as cash outflows. The cash outflows from derivatives for which gross settlement has been 
agreed are matched in part by cash inflows. These cash inflows are not reported in the maturity analysis. If these cash inflows 
were also recognized, the cash outflows presented would be substantially lower. This applies in particular also if hedges have 
been closed with offsetting transactions. 
The cash outflows from irrevocable credit commitments are presented in section entitled "Other financial obligations”, 
classified by contractual maturities.

MARKET RISK 
4.1 HEDGI NG POLICY AND FI NANC IAL DERIVATIVES 
During the course of its general business activities, the TRATON GROUP is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and 
commodity price risks. Corporate policy is to continuously monitor such risks through the TRATON risk management 
systems; actions to mitigate those risks are then taken by the treasury departments at MAN and Scania. There were no 
significant risk concentrations in the past fiscal year. 

83 
 
4.2 MARKET RISK I N THE  TRATON GROU P  
4.2.1 FOREIGN CU RRENCY RISK 
Currency Risk is the risk of negative effects on earnings and balance sheet items denominated in foreign currency, due to 
currency movements. Foreign currency risk in the TRATON GROUP is attributable to investments, financing measures and 
operating activities. Currency forwards, currency options, currency swaps and cross-currency swaps are used to limit risks to 
future cash flows.  
Within MAN, all firm customer orders (firm commitments), the Group’s own purchases, receivables, and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are hedged as a matter of principle. MAN also enters into hedges for forecast foreign 
currency revenue from the series production business within defined hedging limits that are specific to MAN’s business, and 
(on a case-by-case basis) for highly probable customer projects. Hedge accounting is not required to be applied in these cases, 
but it is applied for the most significant forecasted foreign currency revenues. Companies that apply hedge accounting choose 
the hedge ratio of the forecasted revenues based on their experience to avoid inefficiencies. In current or prior reporting 
periods no inefficiencies appeared. Smaller entities mostly do not apply hedge accounting. Currencies that are highly 
correlated with the euro, such as the Danish krone, as well as equity investments or equity-equivalent loans, are only hedged in 
individual instances. According to Scania’s financial policy, Scania’s Management may hedge future currency flows with a 
hedging period varying between 0 and 12 months. For maturities over 12 months, the decision is made by the Board of 
Directors. Hedge accounting is not used in these cases. 
Assets at Scania Financial Services should be financed by liabilities in the same currencies generally. There are no fair value 
hedges. 
Hedging transactions entered into as part of foreign currency risk management were primarily in UK pound sterling, U.S. 
dollars and Brazilian Real.

The non-derivative and derivative financial instruments existing at the end of the reporting period were measured in a 
hypothetical scenario as part of a sensitivity analysis. The effects of a 10% increase/decrease in a currency per exchange rate

4.2.2 I NTEREST RATE RISK 
Interest Rate Risk is the risk of negative effects on interest income and expenses due to movements in interest rates. Financial 
instruments that are sensitive to movements in interest rates are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of fair value risk or 
cash flow risk. Fair value risk is a measure of the sensitivity of the carrying amount of a financial instrument to changes in 
market rates of interest. Cash flow risk describes the exposure to variability in future interest payments in response to interest 
rate movements. Interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps are used to achieve the risk management strategy. Hedge 
accounting is not applied. 
The TRATON GROUP is exposed to interest rate risk from interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Intragroup financing 
arrangements are mainly structured to match the maturities of their refinancing. In the same way, Scania’s Financial Services 
hedges interest rate risks by matching interest rates and maturity periods of its assets and liabilities. Departures from the 
Group standards are subject to centrally defined limits and monitored on an ongoing basis.  
Interest rate risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 is calculated for the companies using sensitivity analyses. Any earnings effects 
of the interest rate sensitivity would be recognized exclusively in profit for the period. 
If market interest rates had been 100 bps higher as of December 31, 2018, earnings after tax would have been €34 million 
higher as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €39 million, December 31, 2016: €23 million). If market interest rates had 
been 100 bps lower as of December 31, 2018, earnings after tax would have been €34 million lower (December 31, 2017: €41 
million, December 31, 2016: €24 million). 
4.2.3 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
Commodity price risk in the TRATON GROUP primarily results from price fluctuations and the availability of commodities.  
The commodity price risks are regularly captured centrally and hedged externally based on defined risk limits, including 
considerations as to whether changes in commodity prices will translate into higher prices of the products sold, to the extent 
that there are liquid markets. Cash-settled commodity futures are used to mitigate these risks. There were no material 
concentrations of risk in the past fiscal year. Cash-settled commodity futures had been entered into at the end of the reporting 
period to hedge commodity price risks relating to gas, steel, nonferrous metals, precious metals, and rubber with a fair value of 
€-1 million (December 31, 2017: €0 million, December 31, 2016: €1 million ). Hedge accounting is not used at present. 
The maximum remaining term of hedges of forecast transactions was 18 months at the end of fiscal 2018. A hypothetical 10% 
increase/decrease in commodity prices is assumed, in line with the sensitivity analysis of currency risks. The potential effect 
on profit for the period of the change in the fair value of the commodity futures is €2 million as of December 31, 2018 
(December 31, 2017: €1 million, December 31, 2016: €1 million) for +10% or €-2 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 
2017: €-1 million, December 31, 2016: €-1 million) for –10%, respectively.

35. Capital management 
The Group’s capital management ensures that its goals and strategies can be achieved in the interests of shareholders, 
employees and other stakeholders. In particular, management focuses on generating the minimum return on invested assets 
in the Industrial Business that is required by the capital markets, and on increasing the return on equity in Financial Services. 
In the process, it aims overall to achieve the highest possible growth in the value of the Group and its divisions for the benefit 
of all the Company’s stakeholder groups. 
 
In order to maximize the use of resources in the Industrial Business and to measure the success of this, we have for a number 
of years been using a value-based management system, with return on investment (ROI) as a relative indicator. 
 
The return on investment (ROI) is defined as the return on invested capital for a particular period based on the operating profit 
after tax. The invested capital is calculated as total operating assets reported in the balance sheet (property, plant and 
equipment, intangible assets (excluding goodwill), investment property, lease assets, inventories, trade receivables and certain 
other assets) less non-interest bearing liabilities (trade payables and advanced payments received). The average invested capital 
is defined as the sum of invested capital at the beginning of the reporting period and the invested capital at the end of the 
reporting period divided by two. Operating profit after tax is calculated by deducting average taxes of 30.0% from operating 
profit. 
 
If the return on investment exceeds the market cost of capital, there is an increase in the value of the invested capital. In the 
Group, a minimum required rate of return on invested capital of 9% is defined, which applies to both the business units and 
the individual products and product lines. Our goal of generating a sustained return on investment of over 15% is anchored in 
Strategy 2025. The return on investment therefore serves as a consistent target in operational and strategic management and is 
used to measure target attainment for the Industrial Business, the individual business units and products. The return on 
investment achieved for the Industrial Business in the reporting period was 8.56%. 
 
Due to the specific features of Financial Services, its management focuses on return on equity, a special target linked to 
invested capital. This measure is calculated as the ratio of earnings before tax to average equity. Average equity is calculated 
from the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period. In addition, the goals of Financial Services are to meet 
the banking supervisory authorities’ regulatory capital requirements and to procure equity for the growth planned in the 
coming fiscal years. To ensure compliance with prudential requirements at all times, a planning procedure integrated into 
internal reporting has been put in place at Financial Services, allowing the required equity to be continuously determined 
based on actual and expected business performance. In the reporting period, this again ensured that regulatory minimum 
capital requirements were always met both at Group level and at the level of subordinate companies’ individual, specific capital 
requirements.

*In addition, for liabilities under guarantees of discontinued operations were €2 million as of December 31, 2017, €5 million as of December 31, 2016 and
€2 million as of January 1, 2016.  
**Discontinued operations had other contingent liabilities of €6 million as of December 31, 2017, €6 million as of December 31, 2016 and €0 million as 
of January 1, 2016. All discontinued operations were deconsolidated in 2018.
 
The contingent liabilities under guarantees relate mainly to guarantees issued for trade obligations of investees, former 
investees, and other companies. They include financial guarantees amounting to €39 million as of December 31, 2018 
(December 31, 2017: €29 million, December 31, 2016: €44 million, January 1, 2016: €35 million).  
Guarantees of €21 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €3 million, December 31, 2016: €4 million, January 1, 
2016: €9 million) are in place for the benefit of subsidiaries and equity investments of Volkswagen AG that are not part of the 
TRATON GROUP. Guarantees for consolidated subsidiaries of the Volkswagen AG not part of the TRATON GROUP and 
nonconsolidated subsidiaries of the TRATON GROUP in the amount of €174 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 
2017: €0 million, December 31, 2016: €2 million, January 1, 2016: €0 million) also exist. The increase in 2018 mainly relates to 
the sale of the Power Engineering business to a Volkswagen AG subsidiary outside the TRATON GROUP. 
Other contingent liabilities relate mainly to contingent liabilities for potential charges from tax risks, which exist for 
Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, in particular. It is not currently considered likely that a claim will be made against 
Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, in connection with these liabilities. In the tax proceedings involving Volkswagen Caminhões 
e Ônibus, and the Brazilian tax authorities, the Brazilian tax authorities take a different position with regard to the tax effects 
of the acquisition structure chosen in 2009 for Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus. In December 2017, an administrative court 
ruled against Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, following an appeal. Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, took legal action

against this ruling by recourse to regular courts in 2018. Because of the potential range of punitive surcharges plus interest 
that may be applied under Brazilian law, the best estimate of the risk in the event that the tax authorities are successful in 
asserting their position entails a degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, a positive outcome is still expected for Volkswagen 
Caminhões e Ônibus. In the event of an adverse outcome, the risk for the total contested period starting in 2009 could be 
approximately €683 million. This assessment is based on the accumulated amounts at the reporting date for the claimed tax 
liability including the potential expected punitive surcharges, as well as accumulated interest, but excluding any future 
interest, and without discounting any cash flows. 
Customer liabilities to financial services companies of the Volkswagen Group and, to a small extent, third parties are covered 
by standard industry buyback guarantees under which TRATON is obliged to buy back vehicles from the financial services 
company in the event of default. The maximum expenses from such obligations amounted to €2,149 million as of December 
31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: €1,903 million, December 31, 2016: €1,722 million, January 1, 2016: €1,623 million). However, 
based on experience, the majority of these guarantees expire without being drawn upon. 
37. Litigation 
In the course of their operating activities, TRATON GROUP and the companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested 
become involved in a great number of legal disputes and official proceedings in Germany and internationally. In particular, 
such legal disputes and other proceedings may occur in relation to suppliers, dealers, customers, employees, or investors. For 
the companies involved, these may result in payment or other obligations.  
Risks may also emerge in connection with the adherence to regulatory requirements. This particularly applies in the case of 
regulatory vagueness that may be interpreted differently by TRATON GROUP and the agencies responsible for the respective 
regulations. In addition, legal risks can arise from the criminal activities of individual persons, which even the best compliance 
management system can never completely prevent. 
Where transparent and economically viable, adequate insurance coverage is taken out for these risks. For the identifiable and 
measurable risks, provisions considered appropriate are recognized and information about contingent liabilities is disclosed. 
As some risks cannot be assessed or can only be assessed to a limited extent, the possibility of loss or damage not being 
covered by the insured amounts and provisions cannot be ruled out.  
TRATON GROUP does not tolerate compliance violations. Neither corruption nor breaches of competition law are tolerated, 
encouraged, or accepted by TRATON. 
IMPORTANT LEGAL CASES  
In 2011, the European Commission launched an antitrust investigation into suspected antitrust violations in the commercial 
vehicles business and sent MAN, Scania and all other commercial vehicle manufacturers affected the statement of objections 
in November 2014, informing them of the allegations brought forward against them. With its settlement decision in July 2016 
the European Commission imposed penalties on five European commercial vehicle manufacturers for "collusive arrangements 
on pricing and gross price increases in the European Economic Area for medium and heavy trucks and the timing and the 
passing on of the costs for the introduction of emission technologies for medium and heavy trucks required by EURO 3 to 6 
standards" from January 17, 1997 to January 18, 2011 (for MAN: until September 20, 2010). MAN’s fine was waived in full as it 
had notified the European Commission about the irregularities as a whistleblower. In September 2017, the European 
Commission then fined Scania €0.88 billion. Scania has appealed to the European Court in Luxembourg and will use all means 
at its disposal to defend itself. Scania had already recognized a provision of €0.4 billion in 2016. Furthermore, antitrust 
lawsuits for damages from customers who purchased or leased trucks were received. As is the case in any antitrust 
proceedings, this may result in further lawsuits for damages.  
In the tax proceedings between MAN Latin America and the Brazilian tax authorities, the Brazilian tax authorities took a 
different view of the tax implications of the acquisition structure chosen for MAN Latin America in 2009. In December 2017, a 
second instance judgment was rendered in administrative court proceedings, which was negative for MAN Latin America. 
MAN Latin America has initiated proceedings against this judgment before the regular court in 2018. Due to the difference in 
the penalties plus interest which could potentially apply under Brazilian law, the estimated size of the risk in the event that the 
tax authorities are able to prevail overall with their view is laden with uncertainty. However, a positive outcome continues to 

91 
 
be expected for MAN Latin America. Should the opposite occur, this could result in a risk of about €683 million for the 
contested period from 2009 onwards, which has been stated within note “Contingent liabilities”. 
In June 2013, the Annual General Meeting of MAN SE approved the conclusion of a domination and profit and loss transfer 
agreement between MAN SE and TRATON SE (formerly Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH, Volkswagen Truck & Bus AG, and 
TRATON AG). In July 2013, award proceedings were instituted to review the appropriateness of the cash settlement set out in 
the agreement in accordance with section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) and the cash 
compensation in accordance with section 304 of the AktG.  
In its final decision announced on June 26, 2018 (and corrected on July 30 and December 17, 2018), the Higher Regional Court 
(Oberlandesgericht) of Munich set the guaranteed dividend and the recurring fixed compensation payment at €5.47 gross per 
share (minus potential corporate taxes and solidarity surcharges at the rates as applicable to the respective fiscal year). The 
amount of the cash settlement payable of €90.29 per share from the Munich Regional Court ruling at first instance was 
confirmed. The decisions of the Higher Regional Court of Munich were published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on 
August 6, 2018, and January 10, 2019. In accordance with Section 305 para. 4 AktG, non-controlling interest shareholders had 
the right to tender their shares to TRATON SE (at that point in time TRATON AG) in consideration for a cash redemption of EUR 
90.29 per share plus interest within two months after this publication date and thereby cease to be shareholders. As a result of 
the court decision the compensation payment increased significantly. Consequently, the domination and profit and loss 
transfer agreement with MAN SE was terminated with effect from January 1, 2019. Following the legal effect of the court 
decisions, TRATON SE (at that point in time TRATON AG) terminated the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement 
for cause in accordance with Section 304 para. 4 AktG with effect as of January 1, 2019. After the publication of the registration 
of the termination, the non-controlling interest shareholders of MAN SE were again entitled to tender their shares to TRATON 
SE (at that point in time TRATON AG) in consideration for a cash redemption of EUR 90.29 per share without additional 
interest. As per December 2018, TRATON SE held 86.87% of the shares and 87.04% of the voting rights in MAN SE. 
In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or about uncertainty 
regarding the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities. This is so as to not compromise the results of the 
proceedings or the interests of the Company.

41. Events after the reporting period 
By resolution of December 14, 2018 the Company changed its legal form to a European Stock Corporation (Societas 
Europaea/SE). The change in legal form became effective upon the registration in the commercial register on January 17, 2019.  
On December 6, 2018 TRATON SE concluded an agreement with a Volkswagen AG subsidiary outside of the TRATON GROUP to 
sell its subsidiary, Volkswagen Gebrauchtfahrzeughandels und Service GmbH, with effect from January 1, 2019. The associated 
assets and liabilities were presented as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.  
After the balance sheet date, 839,380 shares of MAN SE shares were tendered to TRATON SE (see section “Litigation”). This will 
result in a cash outflow of €76 million in 2019. 
No other events occurred after the reporting period that are material for the TRATON GROUP and that could lead to a 
reassessment of the Company.
