    "84": "January 1, 2016).",
    "85": "The book values of MAN SE were continued in the TRATON consolidated financial statements and thus do not include the PPA values resulting from the acquisition of MAN SE by Volkswagen AG.",
    "86": "This is because the contribution of MAN SE into TRATON in 2013 represented a group reorganization and did not meet the definition of a business combination.",
