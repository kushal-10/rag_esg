Our larger sites have recooling plants that allow water to be reused several times and that reduce the temperature of used cooling water before it is \u00addischarged back into a body of water. To protect the Rhine River, we have committed to the step-by-step reduction of heat input from the Ludwigshafen site when set temperature limits are exceeded, for example as a result of long heat waves or low river levels. The supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is associated with a high energy demand. We employ various means in our efforts to keep this as low as possible.

This is how, for example, we have been able to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 95% since 1997. To supply our production sites with energy, we rely on highly efficient combined heat and power plants with gas and steam turbines and the use of heat released by production processes. Comparisons with European emissions trading benchmarks show that our greenhouse gas-intensive chemi\u00ad cal plants also operate at above-average efficiency. Around 50% of BASF Group emissions in 2014 resulted from steam and electricity generation in our power plants as well as in our energy suppliers\u2019 power plants.

In 2014, BASF once again achieved the maximum disclosure score of 100 points, taking first place in the Energy & Materials sector of the Carbon Disclosure \u00adLeadership Index (CDLI). We have already qualified for the index ten times. In 2014, BASF was unable to qualify for the Carbon \u00adPerformance Leadership Index (CPLI), which judges compa\u00ad nies\u2019 climate protection activities. Inclusion in the CPLI \u00adrequires a considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emis\u00ad sions compared with the previous year (\u20134%). Measures \u00adalready taken in previous years are not eligible for consider\u00ad ation. BASF has already implemented numerous measures in the past to \u00adreduce greenhouse gases, which have managed to decrease absolute emissions by just under 49% since 1990 (BASF business excluding the Oil & Gas segment). \u00adFurther improvements have lower potential, preventing us from reaching the CPLI\u2019s high reduction requirement.
