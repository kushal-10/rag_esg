How can we use it more efficiently? How can we store and transport energy with minimal losses in the process? And how can we expand electricity generation from renewables in a cost-effective manner? S M A R T E N E R G Y T H E Q U E S T I O N S We at BASF have been working on answers to these questions for 150 years: by recognizing future trends early on, keeping our research on the cutting edge and finding flexible solutions for society and the environment. Examples include technologies that \u00adenable houses to secure their own energy supply and the nearly loss-free transmission of electricity.
