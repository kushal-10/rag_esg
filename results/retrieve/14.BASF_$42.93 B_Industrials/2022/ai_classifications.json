Digitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us to further automate processes and in this way, manage the \u00adcapacity, availability and efficiency of our plants in line with market conditions, for example, by simulating value streams within our \u00adVerbund structure or through predictive maintenance. Linking data from different sources and using artificial intelligence for smart data analysis opens up numerous opportunities for us to manage our business more \u00adefficiently and improve our processes, for example, in logistics. The combination of products, services and digital offerings also creates new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in agriculture or the personal care industry. In addition, digitalization enables us to further strengthen our innovative power. BASF has one of the most powerful supercomputers in the chemical industry \u2013 Quriosity. We use it to accelerate complex computing processes such as the simulation of molecules, for example. At the same time, we are working on groundbreaking technologies such as quantum computing, including as a founding member of the \u00adQuantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC). We are also involved in other digitalization initiatives such as the Catena-X 29 BASF Report",

One example is creating virtual replicas of \u00adproduction facilities using 3D modeling (digital twinning). This enables us to carry out maintenance and servicing work more efficiently and safely, for example, or further improve employee training. More than 30 3D models are in continuous use at BASF around the world, covering all phases of a plant\u2019s life cycle. Digital tools are also used to access large amounts of data from different sources, intelligently link them together and prepare them for further analysis. This data is analyzed using methods like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, for \u00adexample, to detect and rectify anomalies relating to the plant at an early stage (predictive maintenance). This \u00adreduces unplanned repairs and downtime and optimizes the \u00adcoordination of maintenance and production processes. Data can also be evaluated using AI methods to improve the production process to reduce energy use or emissions. 127 BASF Report 2022 Management\u2019s Report \u2013 Emergency Response, Corporate and Cyber Security Emergency Response, Corporate and Cyber Security GRI 2, 410, 413, 418 SUPPLIERS BASF CUSTOMERS We aim to avoid safety-related incidents as far as",
