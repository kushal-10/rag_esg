On this basis, we have established a global recruiting process. The new system offers improved user-friendliness and is designed to speed up the recruitment process. Artificial intelligence (AI) features enable people applying to BASF to match their CV with all job offers. The solution is scheduled for launch in Asia Pacific in 2024. We want to ensure the availability of qualified employees and safeguard existing knowledge today and in the years to come. At the BASF SE site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we perform analyses to make the demographic situation for different operational job profiles transparent for the responsible leaders. On this basis, we offer specific measures for succession planning, knowledge sharing and moderated knowledge transfer.

This currently applies to Europe and especially Germany, where high energy prices compared with other regions and a challenging regulatory environment are negatively impacting our competitiveness and growth. For more information on our production sites and the Verbund structure, see page 23 Digitalization We want to leverage the diverse growth potential of digitalization, seize the associated opportunities to the benefit of our customers and strengthen our competitiveness. To achieve this, we promote digital skills among our employees, cooperate with partners and make digital technologies and ways of working an integral part of our business. Digitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us to further automate processes. In this way, we steer the capacity, availability and efficiency of our plants in line with market conditions, for example, by simulating value streams within our Verbund structure or through predictive maintenance. Linking data from different sources and using artificial intelligence (AI) opens up numerous opportunities for us to manage our business more efficiently and improve our processes, for example, in logistics. Using AI also supports our transformation to climate neutrality and a circular economy, for example by automatically calculating product-specific carbon footprints",

We expect that the digital disruption of established processes will lead to a considerable increase in efficiency and effectiveness in some fields through the use of artificial intelligence, among other things. BASF is therefore committed to taking a leading role in the digital transformation of the chemical industry. Possible applications of digital technologies and solutions are evaluated along the entire value chain and implemented throughout the company, for example, in production, logistics, research and development, business models and corporate governance.

Strategic risks include structural changes on the global markets, climate change and political developments. Supply security for raw materials, energy and services is increasingly affected by trade disputes, protectionism, sanctions and geopolitical conflicts. To counter these risks, BASF relies on close cooperation with strategic suppliers and continuous monitoring of markets and trends.

The combination of products, services and digital offerings also creates new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in the automotive and personal care industry as well as agriculture. In addition, digitalization enables us to further strengthen our innovative power. In 2023, we started up our new supercomputer Quriosity, which is considerably more powerful than its predecessor of the same name (see page 30). At the same time, we are working on new technologies such as quantum computing, for instance as a founding member of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC). We are also involved in other digitalization initiatives such as the Catena-X network, where we are working with partners to develop a system for standardized data exchange in the automotive value chain. By using a standardized calculation logic for the product carbon footprint (PCF), we help to develop solutions that can reduce CO2 emissions.

Since 2023, we have been offering Campus Events for newcomers in all regions to welcome them to BASF, share general information such as our strategy and give them the opportunity to network with each other. To achieve our ambitious digitalization goals, we are focusing on digital skills development of our leaders and employees, as well as on agile transformation. One example of this is our training course on the current development of generative AI applications. We offer content on this topic for various target groups in the form of self-led learning paths, training courses and individual or group coaching. In this way, we want to enable BASF employees to gain an understanding of data, data analysis and AI. After all, in order to exploit the full potential of AI solutions, it is essential to combine new technologies with the experience and expertise of employees.
