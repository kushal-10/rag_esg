The analysts highlighted BASF\u2019s presence in clean technology markets and its clearly defined strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and water consumption. BASF again achieved Prime status (B-) in the ISS ESG rating developed by Institutional Shareholder Services, placing it in the top 10% of the companies assessed.
