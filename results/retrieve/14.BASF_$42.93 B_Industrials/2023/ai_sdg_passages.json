        "page_content": "AI also supports our transformation to climate neutrality and a circular economy, for example by automatically calculating product-specific carbon footprints or improving management of value chains. The combination of products, services and digital offerings also creates new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in the automotive and personal care industry as well as agriculture. In addition, digitalization enables us to further strengthen our innovative power. In 2023, we started up our new supercomputer Quriosity, which is considerably more powerful than its predecessor of the same name (see page 30). At the same time, we are working on new technologies such as quantum computing, for instance as a founding member of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC). We are also involved in other digitalization initiatives such as the Catena-X network, where we are working with partners to develop a system for standardized data exchange in the automotive value chain. By using a standardized calculation logic for the product carbon footprint (PCF), we help to develop solutions that can reduce CO2 emissions. Portfolio We are steering our portfolio toward innovation-driven growth areas. Following major acquisitions in recent years (battery materials, engineering plastics, agricultural solutions), we plan to further"
